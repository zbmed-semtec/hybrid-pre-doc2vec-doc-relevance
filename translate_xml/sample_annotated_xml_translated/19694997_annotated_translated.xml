MeSHD000273 MeSHD059630 expansion in animal MeSHD044967-free medium supplemented with autologous MeSHD006801 MeSHD001792 lysate. BACKGROUND: MeSHD059630 (MSCs) have been considered for MeSHD006801 regenerative MeSHQ000628 applications, and safe MeSHQ000208 and expansion protocols are needed especially in the context of interspecies contamination. MeSHD006801 MeSHD001792 lysate (PL) has been proposed as animal MeSHD044967 substitute during MeSHD066298 MSC expansion. In this MeSHD014937, a simplified and efficient MeSHD008722 to obtain autologous PL to replace animal MeSHD044967 in MeSHD018929 applications is described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: PL obtained by MeSHD005615 and MeSHD002498 MeSHQ000379 was tested as medium supplement for MeSHD006801 adipose MeSHD059630 (hASC) MeSHQ000208. Differential proliferation, immunophenotypic changes, and differentiation under PL or MeSHD012710 (FBS) were assessed. RESULTS: In contrast to 10% FBS supplementation, cell MeSHD011153 doubling MeSHD013995 was significantly lower when hASCs were cultured with the same concentration of PL (PL 22.9 +/- 1.5 hr vs. FBS 106.7 +/- 6.5 hr, t test, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, hASCs maintained with 2.5% PL supplementation also showed satisfactory results. Immunophenotypic MeSHQ000032 revealed no differences between hASCs cultivated with PL or FBS supplementation and both MeSHQ000208 retained the potential to differentiate into adipose cells. These results demonstrate that autologous PL obtained from the same MeSHD014019 can be used as animal MeSHD044967 substitute in hASC MeSHQ000208. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, evidence is provided that MeSHD001792 provided by a single MeSHD014019 are sufficient to obtain PL for hASC propagation for clinical-scale applications mitigating the potential untoward MeSHQ000009 associated with the MeSHQ000706 of animal-derived MeSHD007202.
