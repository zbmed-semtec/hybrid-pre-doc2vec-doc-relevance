Bidirectional MeSHD001244 of MeSHD012171 diameters and estimated GFR decline: the MeSHD012377 Dam CKD Study. BACKGROUND: Recent MeSHD003430 have reported an MeSHD001244 between MeSHD012171 caliber and MeSHD051436 (CKD), but the MeSHC029931 of the MeSHD001244 between these 2 processes is not clear. In a MeSHD011446 with multiple measurements of MeSHD012171 diameters and MeSHD044967 MeSHD003404, we examined whether baseline MeSHD012171 diameter is associated with MeSHD005544 MeSHD012306 of decreased MeSHD007668 MeSHQ000502, or vice versa. STUDY DESIGN: MeSHD011153-based MeSHD015331. SETTING &amp; PARTICIPANTS: 3,199 MeSHD014922 MeSHD000328 MeSHD000368 43-84 years who were followed up prospectively for 15 years. PREDICTOR: Baseline MeSHD012172 arteriolar and venular diameters for MeSHQ000032 1 and baseline estimated MeSHD005919 (eGFR) categories for MeSHQ000032 2. OUTCOMES &amp; MEASUREMENTS: For MeSHQ000032 1, incident CKD, defined as eGFR &lt;60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) accompanied by a 25% decrease in eGFR, during follow-up. For MeSHQ000032 2, incident MeSHD012172 arteriolar narrowing, defined as a central MeSHD012172 arteriolar equivalent measurement &lt;144.0 μm, and incident MeSHD012172 venular MeSHD004106, defined as a central MeSHD012172 venular equivalent measurement &gt;243.8 μm. RESULTS: Baseline MeSHD012172 arteriolar and venular diameters were not associated with 15-year MeSHD012306 of incident CKD. After MeSHD000223 for age, MeSHD012723, diabetes, MeSHD006973, and other confounders, the multivariable HR of incident CKD comparing the narrowest with the widest quartile was 1.15 (95% CI, 0.74-1.80) for MeSHD012172 arteriolar diameter and 1.05 (95% CI, 0.67-1.67) for MeSHD012172 venular diameter. Similarly, there was no significant MeSHD001244 between eGFR and 15-year MeSHD012306 of incident MeSHD012172 arteriolar narrowing or MeSHD012172 venular widening. Compared with eGFR &gt;90 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (referent), the multivariable HR for those with eGFR &lt;45 mL/min/1.73 m(2) was 1.66 (95% CI, 0.93-2.96) for incident MeSHD012172 arteriolar narrowing and 0.60 (95% CI, 0.17-1.85) for MeSHD012172 venular widening. LIMITATIONS: Lack of data for MeSHD000419 and loss to follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: MeSHD012171 diameters and CKD may run together through shared mechanisms, but are not causally related.
