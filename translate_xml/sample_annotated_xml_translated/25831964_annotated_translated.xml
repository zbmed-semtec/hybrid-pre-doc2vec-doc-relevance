Re-visiting the trans insertion model for complexin MeSHD003250. We have previously proposed that complexin cross-links multiple pre-fusion MeSHD050600 complexes via a trans interaction to MeSHQ000502 as a clamp on MeSHD050600-mediated MeSHD018377 release. A recent NMR study was unable to detect the trans MeSHD003250 interaction of complexin and therefore questioned the previous interpretation of the MeSHD031541 and isothermal titration MeSHD002151 data on which the trans MeSHD003250 model was originally based. Here we present new biochemical data that underscore the validity of our previous interpretation and the continued relevancy of the trans insertion model for complexin MeSHD003250.
