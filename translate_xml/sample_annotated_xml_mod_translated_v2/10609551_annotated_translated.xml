Individual variation in the expression profiles of MeSHD011978 in the MeSHD009830 and MeSHD012668 and identification of alpha2, alpha6, alpha9, and beta3 transcripts. MeSHD009538 evokes dose-dependent and often variable chemosensory responses in MeSHD000818 and MeSHD006801. Earlier MeSHD019370 that MeSHD009538 binds to some MeSHD011978 (nAChR) subtypes in the MeSHD009830 (OB) and MeSHD012668 (TG) led us to investigate the complete nAChR expression profile in each MeSHD014024 and to determine whether inter-MeSHD007206 exist in MeSHD008297 and MeSHD005260 MeSHD051381. Total MeSHD012313 was extracted from individual samples of dissected OB and TG and analyzed by a sensitive MeSHD048348-MeSHD016133 (RT-MeSHD016133) MeSHQ000032 to determine the MeSHD012333 profiles of ten transcripts encoded by the alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, alpha6, alpha7, alpha9, beta2, beta3, and beta4 nAChR MeSHD005796. We found that (a) in the OB, all MeSHD000818 expressed alpha2, alpha3, alpha4, alpha5, alpha7, beta2, and beta4 subunit MeSHD012333, whereas alpha6, beta3, and alpha9 transcripts were expressed in only 17, 28, and 33% of the MeSHD000818, respectively, and (b) in the TG, all MeSHD000818 expressed alpha2, alpha3, alpha6, alpha7, beta2, and beta4 subunit MeSHD012333, whereas alpha9, beta3, alpha4, and alpha5 transcripts were expressed in 4, 38, 88, and 92% of the MeSHD000818, respectively. These results also identified new subunits that are expressed in each MeSHD014024 (alpha2, alpha6, alpha9, and beta3) and demonstrated that individual MeSHD051381 may have different MeSHD014024-specific expression profiles for alpha4, alpha5, alpha6, alpha9, and beta3 transcripts. Such variations are likely to be reflected in the composition of functional receptor subtypes in the MeSHD051381 OB and TG that have different activation and desensitization characteristics to MeSHD000109 and MeSHD009538.
