Spontaneous and MeSHD009153-induced transformation of primary MeSHQ000208 of Msh2-/- p53-/- colonocytes. Loss of MeSHQ000502 of MeSHD053843 (MMR) MeSHD005796 underlies MeSHD003123 (HNPCC). However, the inability to maintain primary MeSHD003106 MeSHD004847 in MeSHQ000208 has limited the MeSHQ000032 of the contribution of MMR MeSHD005796 MeSHQ000002 to colorectal MeSHD063646. We have now established primary MeSHQ000208 of MeSHD004847 from the MeSHD003106 crypts of Msh2-/- p53-/- double-MeSHD018345. These MeSHD002477 undergo spontaneous transformation (soft MeSHD000362 colonies and s.c. MeSHD009369 formation), with a progressively shorter latency as a MeSHQ000502 of increasing passages in MeSHQ000208. MeSHQ000628 of early passage MeSHD002477 with the MeSHD009153 methylmethane thiosulfonate (MMS) further decreases the transformation latency of Msh2-/- p53-/- MeSHD002477. Spontaneous transformation of p53-/- colonocytes is only observed using late passage MeSHD002477, and methylmethane thiosulfonate-treated early passage p53-/- colonocytes do not MeSHD020478 MeSHD009369 when injected into immunodeficient MeSHD051379. Together, these MeSHQ000175 support the pathogenic MeSHD012380 of MMR MeSHD020868 in colorectal MeSHD063646 and provide an MeSHD008962 for the serial assessment of the molecular MeSHD010641 associated with Msh2 MeSHQ000172.
