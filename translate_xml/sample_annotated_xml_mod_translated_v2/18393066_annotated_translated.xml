Producing MeSHD056804 using whole-MeSHD002477 MeSHD004798 in separate MeSHD006868 and methanolysis reactions. This MeSHD012106 examined the effect of using separate MeSHD006868 and methanolysis reactions for MeSHD056804 MeSHD004467 using a whole-MeSHD002477 MeSHD004798 derived from MeSHD000082763 (ATCC 10260). MeSHD056804 yield from separate MeSHD006868 and methanolysis was compared to transesterification reactions where both MeSHD006868 and methanolysis reactions occur in the same reactor. All reactions were conducted at room MeSHD013696. The effect of substituting MeSHD000431 for MeSHD000432 was also studied. Separating the MeSHD006868 and methanolysis reactions did not significantly increase MeSHD056804 yields; however, this approach successfully converted about 99% of MeSHD014280 into MeSHD005227 methyl MeSHD004952 (FAME) and MeSHD005230 (FFA). MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD000431 in place of MeSHD000432 did not significantly improve the MeSHD056804 yield. However, there is evidence that MeSHD000431 may either esterify FFA more quickly than MeSHD000432, or result in a more stable MeSHD004952. The best MeSHD056804 yield was about 90% when a transesterification reaction using MeSHD000432 was followed by one MeSHD006868 and one ethanolysis reaction; however, this is only slightly higher than the 88% MeSHD056804 yield of two transesterification reactions in series (using MeSHD000432 as alcohol).
