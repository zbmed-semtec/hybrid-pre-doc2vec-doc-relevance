[MeSHD009369 search with MeSHD004058-weighted imaging--first experience]. PURPOSE: Assessment of fat-suppressing MeSHD004058 imaging as a tool for MeSHD009369 search in primary oncological staging and follow-up MeSHD000359. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The DWIBS sequence (DWIBS: MeSHD004058-Weighted MeSHD051598 with Background Body Signal Suppression) developed by MeSHD031060 Takahara et al. was implemented in oncological MRI protocols. After measurement of 8 MeSHD014838 with a whole-body protocol, 47 MeSHD051598 were performed on 38 oncological MeSHD010361. 70 exams were performed on 62 MeSHD009369 MeSHD010361 with organ-specific protocols using parallel imaging. A total of 64 MeSHD010361 showed neoplastic lesions in the non-MeSHD004058 sequences. These lesions were evaluated in terms of visibility and signal intensity in DWIBS imaging. Non-malignant changes which showed high signal intensity in MeSHD004058 imaging were recorded in all examinations. RESULTS: 113 of the 125 DWIBS examinations were judged as technically good. MeSHD004058 imaging showed bright signal in the malignant lesions of 58 of the 64 MeSHD010361. The MeSHD009369 of 6 MeSHD010361 showed only moderately bright signal or were not discernible at all. Although partly performed with free MeSHD012119 of the MeSHD010361 and limited spatial resolution of the sequence, lesions with sizes close to voxel-size were able to be visualized. Some of the MeSHD010361 were seen in follow-up examinations and showed signal decrease of their lesions in case of MeSHQ000628 response and signal increase in recurrent MeSHD004194. CONCLUSION: Introduction of MeSHD004058-weighted imaging provides a new independent parameter in oncological scanning. DWIBS meets the requirements of a fast, robust technique. Homogeneous fat suppression allows the MeSHQ000706 of maximum intensity MeSHD011385 which may visualize the spread of the MeSHD004194 at first glance. Most of the MeSHD009369 entities examined in this study showed a bright signal in DWI. Exceptions were some osteoplastic MeSHD009362 and hemorrhaged lesions. Although sensitive, visual evaluation of signal intensity alone showed limited MeSHD012680. Detection of lesions in physiological hyperintense structures may be difficult. DWIBS imaging seems to be a sensitive tool in the search for MeSHD008223 and gastrointestinal MeSHD009369.
