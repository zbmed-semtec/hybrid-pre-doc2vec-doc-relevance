0	10821866	MeSHD003643 signal-induced localization of p53 MeSHD011506 to MeSHD008928. A potential MeSHD012380 in apoptotic signaling.	The mechanism of p53-mediated MeSHD017209 after cellular stress remains poorly understood. Evidence suggests that p53 induces MeSHD016923 by a multitude of molecular pathways involving activation of target MeSHD005796 and transcriptionally independent direct signaling. MeSHD008928 MeSHD010988 a key MeSHD012380 in MeSHD017209. We show here that a fraction of p53 MeSHD011506 localizes to MeSHD008928 at the onset of p53-dependent MeSHD017209 but not during p53-independent MeSHD017209 or p53-mediated MeSHD059447. The accumulation of p53 to MeSHD008928 is rapid (within 1 h after p53 activation) and precedes changes in MeSHD053078, MeSHD045304 release, and MeSHD053148 activation. MeSHD016253 and immuno-MeSHD005453-activated MeSHD002477 sorter MeSHQ000032 of isolated MeSHD008928 show that the majority of mitochondrial p53 localizes to the membranous compartment, whereas a fraction is found in a complex with the mitochondrial import motor mt hsp70. After induction of ectopic p53 without additional MeSHD004249 in p53-deficient MeSHD002477, p53 again partially localizes to MeSHD008928, preceding the onset of MeSHD017209. Overexpression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 or Bcl-xL abrogates stress signal-mediated mitochondrial p53 accumulation and MeSHD017209 but not MeSHD059447, suggesting a MeSHD005246 signaling loop between p53 and mitochondrial apoptotic regulators. Importantly, bypassing the nucleus by targeting p53 to MeSHD008928 using import leader fusions is sufficient to induce MeSHD017209 in p53-deficient MeSHD002477. We propose a model where p53 can contribute to MeSHD017209 by direct signaling at the MeSHD008928, thereby amplifying the transcription-dependent MeSHD017209 of p53.
1	9003241	MeSHD016899 regulates the immunomodulatory activity of neonatal MeSHD012377 MeSHD017628.	MeSHD016899 (beta-IFN) has both pro and anti-inflammatory properties, the balance of which MeSHD007854 to some suppression of MeSHD004194 activity in MeSHD009103 MeSHD010361. Here, we examine the MeSHD056747 of neonatal MeSHD012377 MeSHD017628, the principal CNS accessory MeSHD002477, by beta-IFN and consider the interaction of beta-IFN and MeSHD007371 (gamma-IFN). beta-IFN and gamma-IFN inhibit microglial proliferation. beta-IFN antagonises both gamma-IFN-induced MeSHD015854 of class II expression and the MeSHD001076 of gamma-IFN primed MeSHD002477 to mount a MeSHD016897. In contrast, beta-IFN upregulates microglial MeSHD011961 expression and augments tumour MeSHD009336 factor alpha MeSHQ000378 from suboptimally stimulated MeSHD017628.
2	10970674	MeSHD013995 delay effect in a living coupled oscillator system with the MeSHD010961 of MeSHD016839.	A living coupled oscillator system was constructed by a MeSHD002477 patterning MeSHD008722 with a MeSHD009235, in which parameters such as coupling strength and distance between the oscillators can be systematically controlled. Rich oscillation phenomena between the two-coupled oscillators, namely, desynchronizing and antiphase/in-phase synchronization were observed according to these parameters. Both experimental and theoretical approaches showed that these phenomena are closely related to the MeSHD013995 delay effect in interactions between the oscillators.
3	11158302	MeSHD000107 of a specific promoter MeSHD009707 accompanies activation of the MeSHD055547 MeSHD005796 by MeSHD055544 MeSHD019901 HS2.	On stably replicating MeSHD010957, MeSHD015533 of the MeSHD055547 promoter by the MeSHD055544 MeSHD019901 HS2 enhancer is correlated with an increase in nuclease MeSHD012680 which is limited to the TATA-proximal MeSHD009707 (N1). To elucidate what underlies this increase in nuclease MeSHD012680 and the link between MeSHD002843 modification and MeSHD015870, we examined the MeSHD009698 composition and MeSHD006657 MeSHD000107 status of transcriptionally active and inactive promoters. MeSHD008836 MeSHD004063 of active promoters in nuclei released few MeSHD009707-like MeSHD009698 complexes containing N1 sequences in comparison to results with inactive promoters. We also observed that N1 MeSHD004247 fragments from active promoters are of a subnucleosomal length. Nevertheless, MeSHD047369 experiments indicate that MeSHD006657 and H4 are present on N1 sequences from active promoters, with H3 being dramatically hyperacetylated compared with that from inactive promoters and vector sequences. Strikingly, H3 in the adjacent upstream MeSHD009707 (N2) does not appear to be differentially acetylated in active and inactive promoters, indicating that the MeSHD009707 modification of the promoter that accompanies MeSHD015533 by HS2 is highly directed and specific. However, global MeSHD000107 of MeSHD006657 in vivo by MeSHC012589 did not activate transcription in the absence of HS2, suggesting that HS2 contributes additional activities necessary for MeSHD015533. N1 sequences from active promoters also contain reduced levels of linker MeSHD006657. The detection of a protected subnucleosomal sized N1 MeSHD004247 fragment and the recovery of N1 MeSHD001483 in MeSHD047468 using anti-acetylated H3 and H4 MeSHD000906 argue that N1 is present, but in an altered conformation, in the active promoters.
4	11013229	MeSHD010911 MeSHD009857 MeSHQ000209 MeSHD000782 and p53-dependent and p53-independent MeSHD017209.	The MeSHD010911 MeSHD009857, PTTG, is abundantly expressed in several MeSHD009369. We recently showed that PTTG overexpression is associated with MeSHD017209 and therefore have now studied the MeSHD012380 of p53 in this process. In MCF-7 MeSHD001943 MeSHD002477 that express wild type p53, PTTG overexpression caused MeSHD017209. p53 was translocated to the nuclei in MeSHD002477 expressing PTTG. Overexpression of p53, along with PTTG, augmented MeSHD017209, whereas expression of the MeSHD027383 E6 MeSHD011506 inhibited PTTG-induced MeSHD017209. In MG-63 MeSHD012516 MeSHD002477 that are deficient in p53, PTTG caused MeSHD059447 and subsequent MeSHD017209 that was inhibited by MeSHD061945. A MeSHD061988 augmented PTTG expression in stable PTTG transfectants, suggesting that down-regulated PTTG expression is required for MeSHD002470. Finally, MG-63 MeSHD002477 expressing PTTG showed MeSHQ000175 of MeSHD000782 including the presence of micronuclei and multiple nuclei. These results indicate that PTTG overexpression MeSHQ000209 p53-dependent and p53-independent MeSHD017209. In the absence of p53, PTTG MeSHQ000209 MeSHD000782. These results may provide a mechanism for PTTG-induced MeSHD063646 whereby PTTG mediates MeSHD000782 and subsequent MeSHD002477 transformation.
5	9595262	Identification of APC MeSHD005091 15 MeSHD009154 in MeSHD005190 suspected of MeSHD011125 (FAP).	MeSHD010361 with MeSHD011125 (FAP) reveal numerous colorectal MeSHD000236 as well as benign and malignant extracolonic lesions. MeSHD011125 (APC) MeSHD005796 MeSHD009154 are the crucial genetic defect in FAP. The APC MeSHD009154 molecular MeSHQ000032 of 20 FAP MeSHD005190 was performed using the novel and effective MeSHD008722 of the MeSHD020180 (HDA). All of these MeSHD005190 were screened for MeSHD009154 in APC MeSHD005091 15. APC MeSHD009154 were identified in 4 individuals of two MeSHD005190. These two MeSHD005190 were also screened by the MeSHD011506 truncation test (PTT). The PTT results confirmed previous MeSHQ000175 obtained by HDA. The results of molecular MeSHQ000032 were correlated with the clinical manifestations of extracolonic lesions and MeSHQ000151 MeSHD006984 of MeSHD055213 (CHRPE). Positive correlation of all clinical examinations and MeSHD009154 of MeSHD017491 was observed in all 4 FAP MeSHD010361.
6	7753843	MeSHD016898 and beta down-regulate the expression of MeSHD016222 in MeSHD006801 MeSHD002277.	We investigated the influence of MeSHD016898, beta, and gamma (IFN-alpha, -beta, and -gamma) on the MeSHD004467 of MeSHD016222 (bFGF) by MeSHD006801 MeSHD002292 MeSHD002477. The MeSHD006801 MeSHD002292 MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000556 line SN12PM6 was established in MeSHQ000208 from a MeSHD008168 MeSHD009362 and SN12PM6-resistant MeSHD002477 were selected MeSHD066298 for resistance to the antiproliferative effects of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. IFN-alpha and IFN-beta, but not IFN-gamma, down-regulated the expression of bFGF at the MeSHD012333 and MeSHD011506 levels by a mechanism independent of their antiproliferative effects. MeSHD015536 of bFGF required a long exposure (> 4 days) of MeSHD002477 to low concentrations (> 10 units/ml) of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta. The withdrawal of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta from the medium permitted SN12PM6-resistant MeSHD002477 to resume MeSHD004467 of bFGF. The incubation of MeSHD006801 MeSHD001743, MeSHD011467, MeSHD003106, and MeSHD001943 MeSHD002477 with noncytostatic concentrations of IFN-alpha or IFN-beta also produced MeSHD015536 of bFGF MeSHD004467.
7	11342419	Highly heterogeneous MeSHD019368 of MeSHD000623 (ALAD) MeSHQ000172 in ALAD MeSHD011164.	The properties of 9 MeSHD000623 (ALAD) mutants from MeSHD010361 with ALAD MeSHD011164 (MeSHD000244) were examined by bacterial expression of their MeSHD018076 and by enzymologic and immunologic assays. ALADs were expressed as MeSHD005982 (GST) fusion MeSHD011506 in MeSHD004926 and purified by MeSHD005978-affinity column MeSHD002845. The GST-ALAD fusion MeSHD011506 were recognized by anti-ALAD MeSHD000906 and were enzymatically active as ALAD. The enzymatic activities of 3 ALAD mutants, K59N, A274T, and V153M, were 69.9%, 19.3%, and 41.0% of that of the wild-type ALAD, respectively, whereas 6 mutants, G133R, K59N/G133R, F12L, R240W, V275M, and delTC, showed little activity (< 8%). These variations generally reflect the MeSHD010641 of ALAD in vivo in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000244 and indicate that GST-ALAD fusion MeSHD011506 is indeed useful for predicting of the MeSHD010641 of ALAD mutants. The location of F12L MeSHD009154 in the MeSHD004798's MeSHD015394 indicates that its disturbance of the quaternary contact of the ALAD dimer appears to have a significant influence on the enzymatic activity. MeSHD051379 MeSHD000911 to MeSHD006801 ALAD were developed that specifically recognized a carboxy terminal portion of ALAD, or other regions in the MeSHD004798. This study represents the first complete MeSHQ000032 of 9 mutants of ALAD identified in MeSHD000244 and indicates the highly heterogeneous MeSHD019368 of MeSHD009154 in this disorder.
8	11378394	A localized MeSHD020558 exchange factor, Bud5, determines the MeSHD009949 of division axes in MeSHD015003.	MeSHD020558 are widespread in directing cytoskeletal rearrangements and affecting cellular MeSHD009938. How they do so is not well understood. MeSHD015003 MeSHD002477 divide by budding, which occurs in two spatially programmed patterns, axial or bipolar [1-3]. Cytoskeletal polarization to MeSHD020478 a bud is governed by the Ras-like MeSHD020558, Bud1/Rsr1, in response to cortical landmarks. Bud1 is uniformly distributed on the MeSHD002462, so presumably its regulators, Bud5 MeSHD020558 exchange factor and Bud2 MeSHD020690, impart spatial MeSHD012680 to Bud1 action [4]. We examined the localizations of Bud5 and Bud2. Both Bud1 regulators associate with cortical landmarks designating former division sites. In MeSHD006238, Bud5 MeSHD020478 double rings that encircle the MeSHD009035-bud MeSHD009333 and split upon MeSHD048749 so that each progeny MeSHD002477 inherits Bud5 at the axial division remnant. Recruitment of Bud5 into these structures depends on known axial landmark components. In MeSHD002477 undergoing bipolar budding, Bud5 associates with multiple sites, in response to the bipolar landmarks. Like Bud5, Bud2 associates with the axial division remnant, but rather than being inherited, Bud2 transiently associates with the remnant in late G1, before condensing into a patch at the incipient bud site. The relative timing of Bud5 and Bud2 localizations suggests that both regulators contribute to the spatially specific MeSHQ000517 of Bud1 MeSHD020558.
9	8128315	MeSHD019976 of a MeSHD018076 encoding a putative MeSHD006801 MeSHD008079/MeSHD026503 and assignment of the MeSHD005796 to MeSHD002875 9pter-p23.	We MeSHD058028 the MeSHD019976 of a 3656-bp MeSHD018076 encoding a putative MeSHD006801 MeSHD008079 (VLDL)/MeSHD001053 E (MeSHD001057) receptor. The MeSHD005796 encoding this MeSHD011506 was mapped to MeSHD002875 9pter-p23. Northern MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD012313 identified cognate MeSHD012333 of 6.0 and 3.8 kb with most abundant expression in MeSHD006321 and MeSHD018482, followed by MeSHD007668, MeSHD010920, MeSHD010179, and MeSHD001921. The pattern of expression generally paralleled that of MeSHD008071 MeSHD012333 but differed from that of the MeSHD008077 (LDL) receptor and the MeSHD011973-related MeSHD011506/MeSHD026503 (LRP), which are members of the same MeSHD005796 MeSHD005190. VLDL/MeSHD026503 message was not detected in MeSHD008099, whereas MeSHD012333 for both MeSHD011973 and LRP were found in hepatic MeSHD014024. In MeSHD051379 MeSHD041721, VLDL/MeSHD026503 MeSHD012333 was induced during the transformation of the MeSHD002477 into MeSHD017667. Expression was also detected in MeSHD006801 MeSHD002822 MeSHD002477, suggesting that at least part of the expression observed in MeSHD010920 may be in MeSHD014327, MeSHD002477 which would be exposed to maternal MeSHQ000097. Expression in MeSHD001921 may be related to high levels of MeSHD001057 expression in that organ, an MeSHD019370 of potential relevance to the recently hypothesized MeSHD012380 for MeSHD001057 in MeSHD000544. Our results suggest that the putative VLDL/MeSHD026503 could MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in the uptake of MeSHD014280-rich MeSHD008074 particles by specific organs including striated and MeSHD009206 and MeSHD000273 and in the transport of maternal MeSHD008055 across the MeSHD010920. The MeSHQ000175 presented here, together with recent MeSHD019370 from other MeSHD007753, bring up the possibility that a single MeSHD005796, the VLDL/MeSHD026503, may MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in the MeSHQ000209 of certain MeSHD020478 of MeSHD050197, MeSHD000544, and MeSHD009765.
10	10779687	Importance of MeSHD001244 between permeabilization and electrophoretic forces for intramuscular MeSHD004247 electrotransfer.	MeSHD005796 transfer using electrical MeSHD011674 is a rapidly expanding field. Many studies have been performed MeSHD066298 to elucidate the mechanism of MeSHD004247 electrotransfer. In vivo, the MeSHQ000706 of efficient MeSHQ000379 for MeSHD004247 electrotransfer in MeSHD014024 is recent, and the question of the implied mechanisms is largely open. We have evaluated the effects of various combinations of square wave electric MeSHD011674 of variable field strength and duration, on MeSHD002477 permeabilization and on MeSHD004247 MeSHD014162 in the MeSHD018482 in vivo. One high voltage MeSHD011674 of 800 V/cm, 0.1 ms duration (short high MeSHD011674) or a series of four low voltage MeSHD011674 of 80 V/cm, 83 ms duration (long low MeSHD011674) slightly amplified MeSHD014162 efficacy, while no significant permeabilization was detected using the (51)Cr-MeSHD004492 uptake test. By contrast, the combination of one short high MeSHD011674 followed by four long low MeSHD011674 led to optimal MeSHD005796 transfer MeSHD004526, while inducing MeSHD009132 fibers permeabilization. These results are consistent with additive effects of electropermeabilization and MeSHD004247 MeSHD004586 on electrotransfer MeSHD004526. Finally, the described new combination, as compared to the previously reported MeSHQ000706 of repeated identical MeSHD011674 of intermediate voltage, MeSHD007854 to similar MeSHD005796 transfer MeSHD004526, while causing less permeabilization and thus being likely less deleterious. Thus, combination of MeSHD011674 of various strengths and durations is a new MeSHD008722 for MeSHD018482 MeSHD005796 transfer that may represents a clear improvement in view of further clinical MeSHQ000254.
11	7553864	Multiple proteolytic systems, including the MeSHD046988, contribute to CFTR processing.	The molecular components of the MeSHD011786 system that rapidly degrades abnormal MeSHD008566 and secretory MeSHD011506 have not been identified. The MeSHD019005 (CFTR) is an MeSHD008565 to which this MeSHD011786 is stringently applied; approximately 75% of the wild-type precursor and 100% of the delta F508 CFTR variant found in most CF MeSHD010361 are rapidly degraded before exiting from the ER. We now show that this ER MeSHQ000378 is sensitive to MeSHQ000037 of the cytosolic MeSHD046988, including MeSHC067713 and certain MeSHD010455 MeSHD000447. One of the latter compounds, MeSHC072553, also completely blocks the MeSHD000255-dependent conversion of the wild-type precursor to the native folded MeSHD020478 that enables escape from MeSHQ000378. Hence, CFTR and presumably other intrinsic MeSHD008565 are substrates for proteasomal MeSHQ000378 during their maturation within the ER.
12	10402249	A new MeSHD050257, MeSHC105791, induces MeSHD009369 regression in a MeSHD006801 MeSHD008258 MeSHD064593 model.	MeSHD008258 (WM) is an uncommon lymphoproliferative MeSHD004194 which remains incurable with current MeSHD002985. We have previously established a permanent WM MeSHD002460, WSU-WM, which grows as a MeSHD064593 in severe combined immune deficient (SCID) MeSHD051379. In this study, we investigated the anti-MeSHD009369 effects of MeSHC105791 (a structural modification of the marine, shell-less MeSHD008974 MeSHD010455 constituent MeSHC064570). WSU-WM MeSHD002477 were cultured in RPMI-1640 at a concentration of 2x10(5) MeSHD002477/ml using 24-well plates. MeSHC105791 or MeSHC064570 were added to triplicate wells and MeSHD002452 and viability were assessed after 24, 48 and 72 h. Results showed that both agents were active against WSU-WM, and were able to induce complete MeSHQ000254 inhibition at 100 pg/ml. The efficacy of these agents in vivo was evaluated using the WSU-WM MeSHD016513 MeSHD064593 model. MeSHC105791 and MeSHC064570 were given i.v. via MeSHD013623 MeSHD014680 at 2.0 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg, respectively. The agents were given every second day for three MeSHD007267 which represent the MeSHD020714. MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 inhibition (T/C), MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 delay (T-C), and log10 kill for MeSHC105791 and MeSHC064570 were 0%, 18 days, 2.83 and 67%, 2 days, 0.06, respectively. Based on these MeSHD000818 results, MeSHC064570 was inactive while MeSHC105791 was highly active. We therefore focused further investigation on MeSHC105791 to understand some of its MeSHQ000494. Using two MeSHD005434 assays, MeSHD011419 for MeSHD002453 MeSHQ000032 and MeSHC025942 (MeSHC025942) to detect MeSHD017209, we were able to demonstrate that MeSHC105791 at 10 pg/ml after 24 h arrested 50% of WSU-MW MeSHD002477 in G2M. Concomitantly, 31% of MeSHC105791-treated MeSHD002477 entered MeSHD017209. By 72 h, greater than 75% of the MeSHD002477 became apoptotic. The activity of MeSHC105791 should be evaluated in other MeSHD009369 types and in MeSHD016430.
13	11121808	MeSHD002196 recruitment is impaired in MeSHD000075222 and relates to MeSHD007328's metabolic and vascular actions.	In MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000075222, MeSHQ000002 in both the metabolic and vascular actions of MeSHD007328 have been described. Impaired microvascular MeSHQ000502, a well-established abnormality in MeSHD000075222, may explain part of these MeSHQ000002. In the present study we investigated whether microvascular MeSHQ000502 is impaired in MeSHD000075222 and relates to MeSHD007328's metabolic and vasodilatatory actions. We measured 24-h ambulatory MeSHD001794, MeSHD002196 recruitment after arterial occlusion, and MeSHD012867 MeSHD001775 responses to MeSHD007478 of MeSHD000109 and MeSHD009599 in 18 subjects with untreated MeSHD000075222 and in 18 MeSHQ000517 subjects. Whole body MeSHD007333 and MeSHD007866 MeSHD007328-mediated MeSHD014664 were assessed with the hyperinsulinaemic clamp technique and MeSHD010991. Hypertensive, as compared to normotensive, subjects had a decreased MeSHD007333 (0.8+/-0.3 vs. 1.7+/-0. 6 mgkg(-1)min(-1) per pmoll(-1); P<0.001), MeSHD002196 recruitment after arterial occlusion (21.5+/-5.8 vs. 45.9+/-10.4%; P<0.001), MeSHD000109-mediated MeSHD014664 (331+/-84 vs. 688+/-192%; P<0. 001), and MeSHD007328-mediated MeSHD014664 (median 29.3 vs. 47.2%; P<0.05). Correlation analyses with MeSHD000223 for MeSHD012723, age, MeSHD015992 and MeSHD049629 showed significant relationships of MeSHD002196 recruitment after arterial occlusion with MeSHD001794 (r=-0.68; P<0.01), MeSHD007333 (r=+0.55; P<0.01) and MeSHD007328-mediated MeSHD014664 (r=+0.51; P<0.05), which extended from the normotensive to the hypertensive range. MeSHD012867 microvascular MeSHQ000502 is associated with MeSHD001794 and MeSHD007328's metabolic and vasodilatatory actions, both in normotensive and hypertensive subjects. These MeSHQ000175 offer a potential mechanistic explanation of the links among MeSHD007333, impaired MeSHD007328-mediated MeSHD014664 and MeSHD006973.
14	9626349	MeSHD014568 (uPA) MeSHD004467 by MeSHD006801 MeSHD001940 (myo) MeSHD005347 MeSHD066298: influence of MeSHD016212(1) (MeSHD016212(1)) compared with factor(s) released by MeSHD006801 epithelial-MeSHD002277 MeSHD002477.	The MeSHD014568 (uPA) may be considered as a key MeSHD004798 in the processes of MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 invasion and MeSHD009362. Evidence has been presented that, in MeSHD001940 stroma, uPA is expressed predominantly by MeSHD058628 located at the invasive areas of the MeSHD009369. To examine whether MeSHD015291 type-1 (MeSHD016212(1)) produced by MeSHD001943 MeSHD002477 is a candidate responsible for the induction of uPA-producing MeSHD058628, we studied MeSHD066298 the capacity of normal and MeSHD009369-derived MeSHD006801 MeSHD001940 MeSHD005347 to express uPA and the MeSHD058628 marker alpha-MeSHD009130 MeSHD000199 in response to MeSHD016212(1). Next, we compared these influences with those elicited by factor(s) released by epithelial-MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477. In all 8 MeSHD005347 MeSHD013180 tested, MeSHD016212(1) induced a similar concentration-dependent increase in the fraction of alpha-MeSHD009130-MeSHD000199-positive MeSHD005347. While uPA expression was decreased by MeSHD016212(1) in most of the MeSHD005347 MeSHD013180, 2 MeSHD013180 were relatively insensitive to MeSHD016212(1) in this MeSHD000078682. Although factors present in media conditioned by non-uPA-producing epithelial-MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 could trigger MeSHD005347 to become potent producers of uPA, the MeSHD016212(1) content of the MeSHD017077 were linked to the differential effects of externally added MeSHD016212(1) with MeSHD000078682 to uPA expression. The data demonstrate that, although MeSHD005347 may utilize MeSHD016212(1) secreted by MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 to differentiate into MeSHD058628, MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 secrete factor(s) other than MeSHD016212(1) ultimately responsible for the generation of powerful uPA-producing MeSHD005347.

MeSHD012710 (FCS) was depleted of its MeSHD007074 (MeSHD007074) in a rapid MeSHD008722 using MeSHD011506 G MeSHD002846. 20 ml of FCS was depleted of its MeSHD007074 in less than 80 min by applying 5 ml of FCS to a 1 ml HiTrap MeSHD011506 G MeSHD012685 column followed by appropriate elution. Various concentrations of MeSHD007074-depleted FCS (G-FCS) were used in RPMI-1640 medium to grow the MeSHD051379 MeSHD006825 MeSHD002460 CAy-G (anti-HBs MeSHD007074 mAb producing MeSHD006825 MeSHD002477) and CAy-M (anti-HBs MeSHD007075 mAb producing MeSHD006825 MeSHD002477), which secreted MeSHD006515 MeSHD000954 (MeSHD006514)-reactive MeSHD007074 and MeSHD007075 MeSHD000911 (mAbs), respectively. MeSHD000917 and MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000254 were used as indices to compare the efficacy of RPMI/G-FCS with that of RPMI/FCS and MeSHD044967/MeSHD011506-free Hybri Max (Sigma, MO, USA) MeSHD006825 medium. MAb MeSHD004467 and MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000254 of CAy-G and CAy-M MeSHD006825 MeSHD002460 in RPMI/G-FCS were similar to MeSHQ000208 in RPMI/FCS and significantly better than MeSHQ000208 in Hybri Max. We found that G-FCS was superior to whole FCS as a MeSHQ000208 supplement for the MeSHQ000302 of MeSHD007074 mAbs. MeSHD007074 mAbs were isolated in a single-step MeSHD008722 using MeSHD011506 G MeSHD002846, from the supernatant of CAy-G MeSHD006825 MeSHD002477 cultured in RPMI/10% G-FCS (RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% G-FCS). MeSHD004591 MeSHQ000032 revealed that the purity of MeSHD007074 isolated from the supernatant of CAy-MeSHD019863 cultured in RPMI/10% G-FCS was more than 99%.
16	8110824	Arrangement of MeSHC483858 molecular species in MeSHD004926 MeSHD008566 and reconstituted MeSHD008055 as determined by MeSHD004120 cross-linking of nearest neighbor MeSHD008055.	MeSHD004120 cross-linking has been used to determine the arrangement of MeSHC483858 (PE) molecular species in MeSHD004926 MeSHD008566. No large deviations from random mixing were found in wild-type MeSHD013180 AB1623, either in whole MeSHD002477 or in extracted MeSHD008055 which were reconstituted into multilamellar vesicles. These results suggest, first, that there is little difference in the PE molecular species composition of the three MeSHD008055 monolayers (the inner and outer monolayers of the inner MeSHD008566 and the inner monolayer of the outer MeSHD008566) which contain significant amounts of PE. Secondly, the results suggest that the molecular species within each monolayer and in the extracted MeSHD008055 are arranged close to randomly with no tendency for like molecular species to cluster. E. coli MeSHD013180 L8-2, which has a defect in beta-oxidation and a MeSHD013696-sensitive MeSHD009154 in total MeSHD005227 synthesis, was grown on cis-vaccenate (cis-11,12- octadecenate) to enrich the MeSHD002477 in MeSHC113794. Again, in whole MeSHD002477 or in MeSHD008055 extracted from whole MeSHD002477 and reconstituted into multilamellar vesicles, the species were close to randomly arranged. However, a consistent, slight tendency of divaccenoyl species to pair with like species as compared to pairing with the second most common species, vaccenoyl, palmitoleoyl PE, was noted in both extracted MeSHD008055 and in whole MeSHD002477.
17	12769826	The MeSHD014024 microarray data exchange specification: a MeSHD012111-based, open source tool for sharing MeSHD014024 microarray data.	MeSHD014024 Microarrays (TMAs) allow MeSHD012108 to examine hundreds of small MeSHD014024 samples on a single MeSHD005898 slide. The information held in a single TMA slide may easily involve Gigabytes of data. To benefit from TMA MeSHD013672, the scientific MeSHD012111 MeSHD006301 an open source TMA data exchange specification that MeSHD014836 convey all of the data in a TMA experiment in a format that is understandable to both MeSHD006801 and MeSHD003201. A data exchange specification for TMAs allows MeSHD012108 to submit their data to journals and to public data repositories and to share or merge data from different MeSHD007753. In May 2001, the MeSHD001244 of MeSHQ000473 MeSHD048088 (API) hosted the first in a series of four MeSHD004493, co-sponsored by the MeSHD054547, to develop an open, MeSHD012111-supported TMA data exchange specification. A draft MeSHD014024 microarray data exchange specification was developed through MeSHD004493 meetings. The first MeSHD004493 confirmed MeSHD000091443 for the effort and urged the creation of an open XML-based specification. This was to evolve in steps with approval for each step coming from the stakeholders in the user MeSHD012111 during open MeSHD004493. By the fourth MeSHD004493, held October, 2002, a set of MeSHD065709 (CDEs) was established as well as a basic strategy for organizing TMA data in MeSHD004532-describing XML documents. The TMA data exchange specification is a well-formed XML document with four required sections: 1) Header, containing the specification Dublin Core identifiers, 2) Block, describing the MeSHD010232-embedded array of MeSHD014024, 3)Slide, describing the MeSHD005898 slides produced from the Block, and 4) Core, containing all data related to the individual MeSHD014024 samples contained in the array. Eighty CDEs, conforming to the ISO-11179 specification for data MeSHD004602 constitute XML tags used in the TMA data exchange specification. A set of six simple MeSHD012660 rules describe the complete data exchange specification. Anyone using the data exchange specification can validate their TMA files using a MeSHD012984 implementation written in Perl and distributed as a supplemental file with this MeSHD011642. The TMA data exchange specification is now available in a draft MeSHD020478 with MeSHD012111-approved MeSHD065709 and a MeSHD012111-approved general file format and data structure. The specification can be freely used by the scientific MeSHD012111. Efforts sponsored by the MeSHD001244 for MeSHQ000473 MeSHD048088 to refine the draft TMA data exchange specification are expected to continue for at least two more years. The interested public is invited to participate in these open efforts. Information on MeSHD005544 MeSHD004493 MeSHD014836 be posted at http://www.pathologyinformatics.org (API we site).
18	8858183	MeSHD001053 E in MeSHD009462.	MeSHD001053 E became relevant for MeSHD000072141 in 1993 when the MeSHD001244 of the MeSHD001053 E-epsilon 4 MeSHD000483 with familial and sporadic MeSHD000544 was reported. Since that MeSHD013995, more than 100 confirmations and many MeSHD012106 MeSHD010209 have appeared. A large neurobiological MeSHD008091 concerning the MeSHD012380 of MeSHD001053 E in the MeSHQ000378 of the MeSHD002490 is developing.
19	10632361	Wild-type p53 can induce p21 and MeSHD017209 in MeSHD009447 MeSHD002477 but the MeSHD004249-induced G1 checkpoint MeSHQ000502 is attenuated.	p53 is a MeSHD025521 important in the MeSHD012926 of MeSHD017209. Because p53 MeSHQ000502 as a MeSHD014157, cellular responses depend upon activity of p53 localized in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic sequestration of p53 has been proposed as a mechanism by which the MeSHQ000502 of this MeSHD011506 can be suppressed, particularly in MeSHD009369 types such as MeSHD009447 in which the MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD009154 of p53 is low. Data presented here demonstrate that nuclear p53 MeSHD011506 is expressed in a panel of MeSHD009447 MeSHD002460, and after exposure to MeSHD004249, transcriptionally active p53 expression can be induced. After exposure to both equitoxic IC80 and 10-Gy doses of MeSHD011839, both p53 and p21 were induced, but MeSHD059585 was attenuated. To investigate whether the MeSHD004249 signaling pathway was incapable of inducing sufficient p53 in these MeSHD002477, we expressed additional wild-type p53 after adenoviral vector transduction. This exogenous p53 expression also resulted in p21 induction but was unable to enhance the G1 arrest, suggesting that the pathway downstream from p53 is nonfunctional. Although p53-mediated G1 arrest is attenuated in MeSHD009447 MeSHD002477, the MeSHD001076 of p53 to induce MeSHD017209 appears functional, consistent with its chemosensitive MeSHD010641. This MeSHD014937 demonstrates that p53 is expressed in the nucleus of MeSHD009447 MeSHD002477 and can mediate induction of p21. However, this MeSHD002477 type appears to have an attenuated MeSHD001076 to mediate a MeSHD004249-induced MeSHD059585.
20	10564744	Effect of short-term MeSHD000431 exposure on the MeSHD013493 of MeSHD007031: immunohystochemical study in MeSHD051379.	Morphological changes of the MeSHD013493 (SCN) of the MeSHD007031 were investigated in MeSHD051379 exhibiting intoxication MeSHQ000175 of stages 2 or 3 after a short application term of 6% MeSHD000431. Alterations in MeSHD009457 and MeSHD009474 were examined using anti-MeSHD005904 (GFAP) and anti-MeSHD064026 D28k MeSHD000911, respectively. The results revealed that short-term MeSHD000431 exposure led to strong expression of GFAP-immunoreactivity (GFAP-IR) in the dorsomedial part of the SCN. Furthermore, GFAP-IR MeSHD001253 showed an increase in number and MeSHD006984 with longer processes. However, MeSHD064026 D28k-IR MeSHD009474 were apparently little changed in the SCN. It is concluded that neuroadaptive response of MeSHD001253 could occur before the neurotoxic effects emerge on MeSHD009474 on the SCN.
21	7619574	MeSHD010300: MeSHD004813, MeSHD003933 and management.	Since the introduction of MeSHD007980 MeSHQ000628 for MeSHD010300 over 20 years ago, there has been an awakening of MeSHD012106 interest in this chronic neuro-degenerative disorder. This MeSHD010209 describes current MeSHD032882 of the MeSHD012380 of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of MeSHD010300 and problems associated with both MeSHD003933 and management. It briefly MeSHD020489 both pharmacological and non-pharmacological options for MeSHQ000628. Despite an increasing armoury of available MeSHQ000628, the optimum management for this condition remains controversial.
22	12913112	Dual recognition of the MeSHD012270 and the MeSHD018271 by the MeSHC036318 during MeSHD011506 targeting to the MeSHD004721.	We have analyzed the interactions between the MeSHD018271 (SRP), the MeSHC036318 (SR), and the MeSHD012270 using MeSHD020558 assays, MeSHD015374 experiments, and MeSHD012270 binding assays. Possible mechanisms that could contribute to an enhanced affinity between the SR and the SRP-MeSHD012270 nascent chain complex to promote MeSHD021381 under physiological MeSHD009994 conditions have been explored. MeSHD012270 or 60S MeSHD054658 activate the MeSHD020558 cycle of SRP54 and SRalpha by providing a platform for assembly of the SRP-SR complex. MeSHD015374 experiments revealed high-affinity, saturable binding of MeSHD012270 or MeSHD054658 to the SR. Remarkably, the SR has a 100-fold higher affinity for the MeSHD012270 than for SRP. MeSHC020485 that contain the SR bind nontranslating MeSHD012270 with an affinity comparable to that shown by the MeSHD000069816. An NH2-terminal 319-residue segment of SRalpha is necessary and sufficient for binding of SR to the MeSHD012270. We propose that the MeSHD012270-SR interaction accelerates targeting of the MeSHD012270 nascent chain complex to the RER, while the SRP-SR interaction is crucial for maintaining the fidelity of the targeting reaction.
23	9889302	Bcl-2 overexpression protects the neonatal MeSHD002531 from MeSHD000431 neurotoxicity.	The developing MeSHD009420 is extremely sensitive to MeSHD000431, and exposure often produces a condition known as the MeSHD063647. Although mechanisms underlying developmental MeSHD000431 MeSHQ000633 have long been sought, they remain poorly understood. In this study, we examined the MeSHD001076 of the MeSHD016923 repressor MeSHD005796 bcl-2 to protect against MeSHD000431 neurotoxicity. MeSHD008822 overexpressing bcl-2 in MeSHD009474 were exposed to MeSHD000431 vapor on postnatal days 4 and 5, which is the peak period of vulnerability of cerebellar MeSHD011689 to MeSHD000431. While exposure of wild-type MeSHD000818 to MeSHD000431 resulted in significant loss of MeSHD011689 by P5, similar exposure of homozygous and heterozygous transgenics had no effect on the number of these MeSHD009474. This study suggests that bcl-2 can protect MeSHD009474 from MeSHD000431 neurotoxicity and that modulation of MeSHD016923 effector or repressor MeSHD005796 products may MeSHD010988 a significant MeSHD012380 in developmental MeSHD000431 neurotoxicity.
24	12657676	Synchronized formation and remodeling of MeSHD057907: long-term visualization of hippocampal MeSHD009474 expressing MeSHC033652 tagged with MeSHD049452.	To explore mechanisms governing the formation and remodeling of MeSHD057907 (PSD), we used dissociated MeSHQ000208 of hippocampal MeSHD009474 isolated from transgenic MeSHD004628 expressing MeSHD049452 (GFP)-tagged PSD MeSHD011506 PSD-Zip45 (Homer 1c) and PSD-95. Expression of GFP-tagged PSD molecules was stable, and the remodeling process of PSDs could be followed for >1 week. A higher expression level of GFP-PSD-Zip45 enabled us to quantitatively analyze the amount of PSD-Zip45 clusters during MeSHQ000254. Repetitive imaging of the same MeSHD002477 MeSHD011153 between 11 and 17 d in MeSHQ000208 revealed an increase of the average PSD-Zip45 cluster density from 0.32 to 0.73/microm. Newly generated MeSHD003712 rapidly acquired GFP-PSD-Zip45 clusters, and their density reached the level of parental MeSHD003712 within a few days. Temporal profiles of GFP-PSD-Zip45 cluster density showed a variety of patterns. Some MeSHD003712 showed a monotonous increase of clusters, whereas others showed complex patterns, including short decremental stages. MeSHQ000032 of long-term remodeling of PSD-95-GFP clusters confirmed that the decremental stages were not specific to the PSD-Zip45 clusters. Comparison of the temporal profiles of the cluster density among MeSHD009474 indicated synchronization of both GFP-PSD-Zip45 and PSD-95 MeSHD016000 within individual MeSHD002477. Furthermore, activation of MeSHD017868 suppressed the decremental stages of cluster remodeling. These MeSHD019370 suggest the presence of signaling mechanisms that can induce synchronized addition or elimination of PSD MeSHD011506 throughout MeSHD009473 of a single MeSHD009474.
25	7856079	Genetic MeSHQ000032 of MeSHC000623921: examination of the MeSHD012380 of L2 and MeSHC010200 MeSHD005796 in viral MeSHQ000209.	The monopartite MeSHD004247 MeSHD016678 of MeSHD027461 curly top MeSHD017791 (BCTV, MeSHD013180 Logan) contains four leftward (complementary sense) MeSHD016366 (MeSHD016366) designated L1, L2, MeSHC010200, and L4. We investigated the MeSHQ000502 of the L2 and MeSHC010200 MeSHD016366 by mutational MeSHQ000032. We found that in MeSHD014026 benthamiana and sugarbeet MeSHD010944, neither a functional L2 nor a functional MeSHC010200 MeSHD005796 is required for MeSHQ000472. Double mutants were also infectious, and no evidence for a synergistic effect of these MeSHD005796 was evident. However, while sugarbeet MeSHD010944 inoculated with L2 or MeSHC010200 mutants showed MeSHQ000175 that were indistinguishable from those elicited by wild type MeSHD014780, mutant-inoculated N. benthamiana MeSHD010944 displayed a novel MeSHD010641 in which recovery of the MeSHD010944 from initially severe MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000175 was greatly enhanced. Enhanced recovery was associated with a large reduction in MeSHD004279 levels. Our studies did not provide evidence for functional homology between the BCTV L2 MeSHD005796 and its presumed homologue (AL2) in the bipartite MeSHD017791. In contrast, mutants with lesions in the MeSHC010200 ORF accumulated three- to five-fold less MeSHD004247 than wild type MeSHD014780 in a MeSHD011523 replication MeSHQ000032, consistent with the interpretation that the BCTV MeSHC010200 MeSHD005796 is a homologue of the bipartite MeSHD017791 AL3 MeSHD005796 which is known to MeSHQ000502 as a replication enhancer. Functional homology was directly confirmed in experiments which demonstrated that the BCTV MeSHC010200 MeSHD005796 can MeSHD003165 a MeSHC000623906 AL3 mutant, and vice versa.
26	12194796	[Polymorphisms of ACE-1 and MTHFR MeSHD005796 and MeSHD020022 of MeSHD000083242].

The polymorphisms of ACE-1 and MTHFR MeSHD005796 in the peripheral MeSHD007962 of 143 MeSHD010361 with IS and 154 MeSHQ000517 were analyzed using MeSHD016133- MeSHD012150. The MeSHQ000453 of II, ID, and MeSHC007792 MeSHD005838 of ACE-1 MeSHD005796 were 37.1%, 48.3%, and 14.7% respectively in IS MeSHD010361,and were 44.2%, 37.7%, and 18.2% respectively in the MeSHQ000517. The MeSHD012306 of MeSHD020521 in IS group was 1.2 MeSHD013995 that in the MeSHD035061. The MeSHQ000453 of TT, CT, and CC MeSHD005838 of MTHFR MeSHD005796 were 14.0%; 45.5%, and 40.5% respectively in the IS group, and 5.2%, 31.8%, and 63.0% respectively in the MeSHD035061. The MeSHQ000453 of TT MeSHD005838 was 5.2% in the MeSHD035061 and 1.4% in the IS group (P < 0.05). The MeSHQ000453 of T MeSHD000483 was 21.10% in the MeSHD035061 and 36.65% in the IS group (P < 0.01). The individuals with TT + ID or CT + ID were more susceptible to IS. The individuals with TT + ID were 4.3 MeSHD013995 susceptible to IS than the MeSHQ000517, and the individuals with CT + ID were 1.63 MeSHD013995 susceptible to IS than the MeSHQ000517. However, the individuals with CC + ID were less susceptable to IS in comparison to the MeSHQ000517 (P = 0.003). TT and CT MeSHD005838 of MTHFR MeSHD005796 may be the MeSHD012307 of IS. There is a co-effective action between polymorphisms of ACE-1 MeSHD005796 and those of MTHFR MeSHD005796 in the MeSHQ000209 of IS. CC MeSHD005838 may have a protective effect against IS.
27	12496047	Psychosocial predictors of BRCA MeSHD003376 and testing decisions among urban MeSHD001741 MeSHD014930.	MeSHD005817 and testing for MeSHD009154 in XXX (BRCA)1/2 MeSHD005796 that increase MeSHD001943 susceptibility potentially offer a number of benefits (e.g., more informed MeSHD003657 regarding MeSHD001943 MeSHQ000517 options) but also raise potential problems (e.g., issues of discrimination). However, the MeSHD008091 suggests that MeSHD001741 MeSHD014930 underuse MeSHQ000235-related services. Therefore, the primary aim of the current study was to investigate predictors of the MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD005817 and testing for MeSHD001943 susceptibility in this MeSHD011153. Participants were 76 MeSHD001741 at increased MeSHD012306 for MeSHD001943 attributable to their MeSHD005190 MeSHQ000266 of the MeSHD004194. Participants were recruited from an urban MeSHD055088 clinic and completed MeSHD014894 assessing sociodemographic information, MeSHD001943 MeSHD019359, MeSHD001943-specific MeSHD000079225, and perceived benefits of and barriers to BRCA testing. Free BRCA MeSHD003376 and testing were offered to all interested participants, and MeSHD014894 were completed before MeSHD003376 sessions. On the basis of their subsequent acceptance or refusal of these services, participants were described as having either: (a) declined BRCA-related MeSHD005817 (GC-); (b) participated in MeSHD005817 but refused MeSHD005820 (GC+GT-); or (c) participated in both MeSHD005817 and testing (GC+GT+). Results revealed that participants who declined MeSHD003376 had significantly less MeSHD019359 of MeSHD001943 MeSHQ000235 than those who accepted both MeSHD003376 and testing. No differences emerged among the three groups in terms of perceived benefits of testing. However, participants declining MeSHD003376 demonstrated significantly higher perceived barrier scores compared with those accepting MeSHD003376 and testing. Specifically, those who did not participate in MeSHD003376 reported greater anticipation of negative emotional responses to testing and more concern about MeSHD013240, whereas those who underwent both MeSHD003376 and testing had significantly lower MeSHD005190-related MeSHD006167. Finally, MeSHD009369-specific distress was positively associated with participation in MeSHD003376, regardless of participation in testing. The current MeSHQ000175 underscore the need for refinement of outreach and intervention efforts that both increase MeSHD001364 of BRCA MeSHD003376 and testing among MeSHD001741 MeSHD014930 and provide information to those considering these options.
28	8873134	Assignment of Alzheimer's MeSHD053764 (PS-1) MeSHD005796 to 14q24.3 by MeSHD005453 MeSHD017403.	MeSHD053764 (PS-1) was suggested to be localized on 14q24.3 based on linkage MeSHQ000032 and MeSHD018076 MeSHD019976. The final identification of PS-1 as the causal MeSHD005796 for MeSHD000544 (AD) was concluded based on finding of the MeSHD017354 in the candidate MeSHD018076 linked with MeSHD010375 with early-onset familial AD. We present evidence of its physical MeSHD002874 of PS-1 by MeSHD005453 MeSHD017403 MeSHD008722.
29	7964823	MeSHD001053 E polymorphism in MeSHD044466 MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 or MeSHD015140.	MeSHD001053 E (MeSHD001057) MeSHD010988 a key part in MeSHD050356 both in the MeSHD008099, and in the CNS. To clarify the MeSHD001244 of MeSHD001057 polymorphism with MeSHD000544 and MeSHD015140 in MeSHD007564, 13 MeSHD010361 with early onset (age > or = 65) sporadic MeSHD000544, 40 MeSHD010361 with late onset (age < or = 65) sporadic MeSHD000544, 19 MeSHD010361 with MeSHD015140, and 49 non-demented MeSHQ000517 subjects were analysed. The results showed a significantly increased MeSHQ000453 of the epsilon 4 MeSHD000483 in the MeSHD010361 with late onset sporadic MeSHD000544 (0.25), but not in the MeSHD010361 with early onset sporadic MeSHD000544 (0.04) or in the MeSHD010361 with MeSHD015140 (0.13) compared with MeSHQ000517 (0.09). The raised MeSHQ000453 of the epsilon 4 MeSHD000483 in the MeSHD010361 with late onset sporadic MeSHD000544 was of a lower magnitude than that in MeSHD014481 and Canadian studies. This may in part be due to a lower epsilon 4 MeSHQ000453 in the normal MeSHD044466 MeSHD011153 and reflect the lower MeSHD009017 from MeSHD000544 in MeSHD007564.
30	12823867	Statistical implications of pooling MeSHD012313 samples for microarray experiments.	"Microarray MeSHD013672 has become a very important tool for studying MeSHD059467 under various conditions. Biologists often pool MeSHD012313 samples extracted from different subjects onto a single microarray chip to help defray the MeSHD003365 of microarray experiments as well as to correct for the technical difficulty in getting sufficient MeSHD012313 from a single subject. However, the statistical, technical and financial implications of pooling have not been explicitly investigated. Modeling the resulting MeSHD015870 from sample pooling as a mixture of individual responses, we derived expressions for the MeSHD000073886 and provided both upper and lower bounds for its value in terms of the variability among individuals and the number of MeSHD012313 samples pooled. Using ""virtual"" pooling of data from real experiments and MeSHD003198, we investigated the statistical properties of MeSHD012313 sample pooling. Our study reveals that pooling MeSHD001688 samples appropriately is statistically valid and efficient for microarray experiments. Furthermore, optimal pooling design(s) can be found to meet statistical requirements while minimizing total MeSHD003365. Appropriate MeSHD012313 pooling can provide equivalent MeSHD011209 and improve MeSHD004526 and MeSHD003362 for microarray experiments with a modest increase in total number of subjects. Pooling schemes in terms of replicates of subjects and arrays can be compared before experiments are conducted."
31	9740717	Analyzing MeSHD002843 structure and MeSHD014157 binding in MeSHD015003.	The study of MeSHD002843, once MeSHD013850 to be a purely structural matrix serving to compact the MeSHD004247 of the MeSHD016678 into the nucleus, is of increasing value for our MeSHD032882 of how MeSHD004247 MeSHQ000502 in the MeSHD002477. This article provides two basic MeSHQ000379 for the study of MeSHD002843 in vivo. The first is a MeSHD003850-based MeSHD008722 for the MeSHQ000628 of isolated nuclei to resolve the MeSHD002843 structure of a particular region; the second employs MeSHC007482 footprinting of whole MeSHD002477 in vivo to determine the binding of factors to cis MeSHD004602 in the locus of interest. Specific examples illustrating the MeSHQ000379 described are given from our MeSHD014937 on the MeSHD012926 of the MeSHD015003 PHO8 MeSHD005796, but have also been successfully and reliably applied to the study of many other MeSHD015003 loci. These MeSHQ000379 make it possible to correlate the binding of a MeSHD015534 with an altered or perturbed MeSHD002843 MeSHD009938 at a specific locus.
32	12163012	MeSHD053773 modulates MeSHD020780 MeSHD004467 through the Ras/MAPK signaling pathway in transformed MeSHD015603.	MeSHD051379 transformed MeSHD015603 cultured in the presence of MeSHD053773 (MeSHD053773) acquire a set of morphological and functional properties giving rise to a more motile MeSHD010641 that expresses mesenchymal markers. In this MeSHD014937, we present evidence showing that MeSHD053773 stimulates cellular MeSHD004467 of MeSHD020782-9 (MeSHD020780), a MeSHD045726 that MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in tumoral invasion. Our results demonstrate that TGF-beta1stimulates MeSHD020782-9 MeSHD004467 and MeSHD020782-9 promoter activity in a process that depends of the activation of the Ras-ERK1,2 MAP MeSHD010770 pathway. The latter was demonstrated by cellular MeSHD014162 of MeSHD053773-sensitive MeSHD002477 with a RasN17 mutant MeSHD005796, using MeSHC093973, a MeSHD020929 1,2 inhibitor, and treating MeSHD002477 with anti-sense oligodeoxinucleotides. The enhanced MeSHD020782-9 MeSHD004467 proved to be an important factor in the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties as shown by the MeSHQ000706 of a specific inhibitor of MeSHD020782-9 (MeSHC078131) that inhibits the MeSHD053773-stimulated invasive and migratory properties of these transformed MeSHD015603.
33	11919175	MeSHC060506 induces MeSHD002633 of immature and modulates MeSHD016207-release in mature MeSHD006801 MeSHD003713 for emergence of Th2 MeSHD007109.	MeSHC060506 (S1P) is a potent extracellular lysolipid MeSHC030242 mediator that is released after MeSHD007073-stimulation of MeSHD008407. Here we investigated the MeSHD001688 activity and intracellular signaling of S1P on MeSHD006801 MeSHD003713 (DC), which are specialized MeSHD000938 with the MeSHD001076 to migrate into peripheral MeSHD014024 and MeSHD008198, as well as MeSHQ000517 the activation of naive MeSHD013601. We show that immature and mature DC express the MeSHD012333 for different MeSHD000081025, such as endothelial differentiation MeSHD005796 (EDG)-1, EDG-3, EDG-5, and EDG-6. In immature DC, S1P stimulated MeSHD037342-sensitive Ca2+ increase MeSHD000199-MeSHD058105 and MeSHD002633. These responses were lost by DC matured with MeSHD008070. In maturing DC, however, S1P inhibited the MeSHQ000378 of MeSHD014409 and MeSHD007378 (IL)-12, whereas it enhanced MeSHQ000378 of MeSHD016753. As a consequence, mature DC exposed to S1P showed a reduced and increased capacity to generate allogeneic Th1 and Th2 responses, respectively. In summary, our study implicates that S1P might regulate the trafficking of DC and ultimately favor Th2 MeSHD008214-dominated MeSHD007109.
34	11001403	Characterization of novel neutralizing MeSHD000911 specific to MeSHD006801 MeSHD051101.	MeSHD051101 (NTN) a structural and functional relative of MeSHD051100, was originally identified based on its MeSHD001076 to support the MeSHD013534 of sympathetic MeSHD009474 in MeSHQ000208. Similar to MeSHD051100 (MeSHD051100), MeSHD051101 has been shown to bind to a high affinity MeSHD017261 (GPI)-linked receptor (GFRalpha2) and induce MeSHD010766 of the MeSHD020794 Ret, resulting in the activation of the MeSHD020928 (MAPK) signalling pathway. A panel of six novel MeSHD051189 MeSHD000911 (MAbs) specific to MeSHD006801 MeSHD051101 has been developed and characterized. Four of the MAbs tested inhibit, to varying degrees, binding of NTN to the GPI-linked GFRalpha2 receptor. Three MAbs cross-react with the MeSHD051189 homolog. These MeSHD000906 have been shown to be useful MeSHD007202 for MeSHD015153, MeSHD007150, and also for the MeSHQ000254 of a sensitive, quantitative MeSHD004797 (MeSHD004797) for MeSHD006801 NTN. Novel, specific MAbs with varying MeSHD000939 MeSHD012680 and blocking activity MeSHD014836 be valuable tools for both the MeSHD066298 and in vivo characterization of NTN and its relationship to the GFRalpha2 and Ret receptors.
35	12819206	A green-emitting fluorescent MeSHD011506 from Galaxeidae MeSHD037421 and its monomeric version for MeSHQ000706 in fluorescent labeling.	"We have cloned a MeSHD005796 which encodes a fluorescent MeSHD011506 from the stony MeSHD037421, Galaxeidae. This MeSHD011506 absorbs MeSHD008027 maximally at 492 nm and emits green MeSHD008027 at 505 nm, and as a result, we have designated it ""Azami-Green (AG)."" Despite sharing a similar spectral profile with MeSHC485184 (EGFP) (Clontech), the most popular variant of the Aequorea MeSHD014739 MeSHD049452, the identity between these two MeSHD011506 at the MeSHD000596 level is only 5.7%. However, since AG has a high extinction coefficient, MeSHD005453 quantum yield, and MeSHD000143 stability, it produces brighter green MeSHD005453 in MeSHD002478 than EGFP. Similar to other fluorescent MeSHD011506 isolated from MeSHD037421 MeSHD000818, AG MeSHD020478 a tight tetrameric complex, resulting in poor labeling of MeSHQ000648 such as the MeSHD002462 and MeSHD008928. We have converted tetrameric AG into a monomeric MeSHD020478 by the introduction of three MeSHD019943, which were recently reported to be effective for monomerizing the MeSHC413662 from Discosoma MeSHD037421 (MeSHC413663, Clontech). The resultant monomeric AG allowed for efficient fluorescent labeling of all of the MeSHQ000648 and MeSHD011506 tested while retaining nearly all of the brightness of the original tetrameric MeSHD020478. Thus, monomeric AG is a useful monomeric green-emitting fluorescent MeSHD011506 comparable to EGFP."
36	11034064	MYB MeSHD009857 amplification in hereditary BRCA1 MeSHD001943.	MeSHD055028 MeSHQ000032 has demonstrated that MeSHD001943 from BRCA1 and BRCA2 MeSHD018095 carriers contain a large number of chromosomal copy number gains and losses. A high regional copy number gain at 6q22-q24 was observed in one BRCA1 MeSHD009369, and MeSHD005453 MeSHD017403 MeSHQ000032 indicated a strong amplification of the MYB MeSHD009857 (15 copies of MYB compared with 1 copy of MeSHD002896 MeSHD002503). MeSHD005453 MeSHD017403 MeSHQ000032 revealed amplification of MYB in 5 (29%) of 17 BRCA1 MeSHD001943, whereas none of 8 BRCA2 MeSHD009369 and 13 MeSHD001943 MeSHD002460, and only 2 of 100 sporadic MeSHD001943 exhibited altered MYB copy numbers. MeSHD005784 resulted in MeSHD012333 overexpression as determined by MeSHD015152 and MeSHD020411 MeSHQ000032, and MeSHD011506 overexpression by immunohistochemical MeSHD013194. We conclude that MYB amplification is infrequent in sporadic MeSHD001943 but common in MeSHD001943 from BRCA1 MeSHD009154 carriers, suggesting a MeSHD012380 of this MeSHD002453 regulator and MeSHD014157 in the progression of some BRCA1 MeSHD009369. However, we cannot rule out the significance of other MeSHD005796 in the 6q22-q24 amplicon.
37	8163187	Expression of the MeSHD005796 encoding the MeSHD011505-deficient MeSHD006801 MeSHD011972 in MeSHD008822.	MeSHQ000002 in the MeSHD011972 (IR) in diabetic MeSHD010361 have been given much MeSHD001288. To MeSHD019484 the MeSHD012380 of such MeSHQ000002, we generated a transgenic (TG) MeSHD051379 MeSHD017770 the MeSHD018076 encoding a MeSHD011505 (TK)-deficient MeSHD006801 IR (hIR), under the MeSHQ000517 of the native promoter. The TG MeSHD051379 expressed the MeSHD019076 (TG) MeSHD012333 in the MeSHD008099, as identified in MeSHD015152. Analyses of various MeSHD014024 by MeSHD048348-MeSHD016133 revealed that expressions of the TG MeSHD012333 in MeSHD001921, MeSHD006321, MeSHD007668, MeSHD008168, MeSHD013270, MeSHD018482 and MeSHD000273 were higher than those seen with the endogenous MeSHD051379 IR (mIR), but expression in MeSHD007421, MeSHD003106, MeSHD013154, MeSHD013737 and MeSHD010053 were approximately half those seen with the endogenous mIR. In the MeSHD008099, the expression of the TG was about one tenth that of the endogenous mIR. In analyses of MeSHD007328 binding and IR autophosphorylation, using a MeSHD006801-specific anti-IR antibody, the TK-deficient hIR was synthesized in the MeSHD014024 of the TG MeSHD051379. Despite the expression of TK-deficient hIRs in various MeSHD014024, including the major MeSHD007328-target MeSHD009132 and MeSHD000273, of the TG MeSHD051379, no MeSHD018149 was observed as assessed by the intraperitoneal MeSHD005951, before and after MeSHD013395 feeding for 55 weeks. Our results suggest that a higher expression of the mutated IR, especially in the MeSHD008099 which is another major MeSHD007328-target MeSHD014024, or additional pathogenic factors, environmental or genetic, might be required for MeSHD018149.

However, recent MeSHD058028 of studies in a variety of MeSHD023421 of inflammatory MeSHD003711, coupled with detailed pathological MeSHQ000032 and MeSHD059906 studies of MeSHD009103 MeSHD010361, indicate that the events involved in the formation of the MeSHD009103 lesion may be more complicated. This complex MeSHQ000209 is reflected in the variable response of MeSHD009103 MeSHD010361 to MeSHD056747.
39	10744039	Lack of evidence of MeSHD001244 of p21WAF1/CIP1 polymorphism with MeSHD008175 susceptibility and MeSHD011379 in MeSHD013624.	An MeSHD001244 between the Arg MeSHD000483 of the p21WAF1/CIP1 MeSHD003062 31 polymorphism and MeSHD008175 has been reported. However, the MeSHD005838 MeSHQ000600 of the p21 MeSHD003062 31 polymorphism, as well as the MeSHD001244 of this polymorphism with MeSHD008175 MeSHD012306 and MeSHD011379, remain undefined in the Taiwanese MeSHD011153. Therefore, we investigated the MeSHD005838 MeSHQ000600 of the p21 MeSHD003062 31 polymorphism in 155 MeSHD008175 MeSHD010361 and 189 non-MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000517. The MeSHD005838 MeSHQ000453 in the Taiwanese non-MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000517 were 0.51 (Ser) and 0.49 (Arg). Chi2 MeSHQ000032 indicated significant differences in Taiwanese MeSHD005838 MeSHQ000600 of p21 from those reported for Swedes (P=0.001), Caucasians (P=0.001), Indians (P=0.001), and MeSHD001741 (P=0.001). However, our data did not demonstrate an MeSHD001244 of the Arg MeSHD000483 of the p21 polymorphism with MeSHD008175 MeSHD012306 in MeSHD013624. MeSHD008175 MeSHD010361 with Ser/Arg and Arg/Arg MeSHD005838 were at a nonsignificant 1.15-fold increased MeSHD012306 of MeSHD008175 when compared to individuals with the Ser/Ser MeSHD005838 (95%CI, 0.70-1.86). In addition, although p21 is a downstream target of p53, we found no significant correlation of the p21 polymorphism with the p53 polymorphism and MeSHD016158 MeSHD009154 in MeSHD008175 MeSHD010361. We further investigated the MeSHD001244 of the p21 polymorphism with MeSHD011379 in 154 MeSHD008175 MeSHD010361. MeSHD010361 with the Ser/Ser MeSHD005838 tended to have a poorer MeSHD011379 than those with the Ser/Arg and Arg/Arg MeSHD005838 (P=0.097, by the log rank test). Our data suggest that the p21 MeSHD003062 31 polymorphism may not MeSHD010988 a significant MeSHD012380 in MeSHD009369 susceptibility and the MeSHD011379 of MeSHD008175 MeSHD010361 in MeSHD013624.
40	12441075	A mechanism in MeSHD004854 MeSHD063646: inhibition of MeSHD016212 1-mediated induction of MAPK/p21 by LMP1.	MeSHD004854 (MeSHD004854)-infected, gastric MeSHD004847 line GT38 is resistant to MeSHD053773-mediated MeSHQ000254 inhibition and MeSHD017209, although MeSHD053773 partially induces MeSHD004854 reactivation in the MeSHD002477. These MeSHQ000175 indicate that MeSHQ000002 exist in these MeSHD002477 in the MeSHD053773-mediated signaling pathway, influencing MeSHQ000254 inhibition and MeSHD017209. In order to characterize the steps with MeSHQ000002, we analyzed the MeSHD053773/MAPK/p21 pathway in the MeSHD002477. MeSHD053773 activated MAPK (ERK 1/2) and p21 in the MeSHD053773-susceptible MeSHD002460 HSC-39 but not in GT38 MeSHD002477. GT38 MeSHD002477 had higher constitutive levels of ERK 1/2 MeSHD010766 and p21 expression than did HSC-39 MeSHD002477. MeSHC113580, a specific inhibitor of MeSHD020929, suppressed MeSHD053773-mediated ERK 1/2 MeSHD010766 and p21 induction in HSC-39 MeSHD002477 and constitutive ERK 1/2 MeSHD010766 in GT38 MeSHD002477. MeSHD004854 latent MeSHD008565 1 (LMP1) induced constitutive ERK 1/2 MeSHD010766 and MeSHD016328 activation in LMP1-transfected HSC-39 MeSHD002477, which then became resistant to MeSHD053773-mediated MeSHQ000254 inhibition, MeSHD053773-mediated ERK 1/2 MeSHD010766, and p21 induction, and proliferated in low-MeSHD044967 medium. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the MeSHD053773/MAPK/p21 pathway is required for MeSHD053773-mediated MeSHQ000254 inhibition, and that the resistance to TGF in GT38 MeSHD002477 is derived from constitutive MAPK MeSHD010766 induced by LMP1.
41	9325332	Sp1 and Sp3 regulate expression of the neuronal MeSHD011978 beta4 subunit MeSHD005796.	Neuronal MeSHD011978 MeSHD010988 important MeSHD012380 in MeSHD015398 within the MeSHD009420. The receptors exist in a variety of functionally distinct subtypes that are determined by their subunit structures. The subunits are encoded by 11 MeSHD005796, alpha2-alpha9 and beta2-beta4. Three of the MeSHD005796, alpha3, alpha5, and beta4, are tightly clustered, and their encoded MeSHD011506 make up the predominant receptor subtype in the MeSHD017933. The tight linkage of the MeSHD005796 suggests there may be a common regulatory mechanism underlying their expression. However, although their expression patterns significantly overlap, they are not identical, indicating that independent regulatory mechanisms must also exist. Our studies have focused upon the MeSHD005796 encoding the beta4 subunit for which we have identified several MeSHD050436. One of these MeSHD004602, E2, specifically interacts with the general MeSHD014157 Sp1. Here we show that another member of the Sp MeSHD005190 of factors, Sp3, can specifically interact with E2 whereas two other members, Sp2 and Sp4, cannot. Co-MeSHD014162 experiments indicate that Sp3 can transactivate a beta4 promoter/MeSHD017930 construct and, furthermore, that Sp1 and Sp3 can transactivate the beta4 reporter construct synergistically. The MeSHD015533 is dependent upon an intact E2 and may involve direct interactions between Sp1 and Sp3.
42	12707770	The MeSHD060449 and its MeSHD012380 in MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254.	MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 depends on the aberrant activation of MeSHD015398 that MeSHQ000517 MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000254 and MeSHD013534 and MeSHD010988 important MeSHD012380 in normal MeSHD047108. This MeSHD016454 MeSHD014836 focus on one of the most powerful pathways, the canonical Wnt MeSHD015398 cascade, which has been originally described in MeSHD014714 and non-MeSHD014714 MeSHD047108 and subsequently associated with the MeSHQ000254 of a multitude of different MeSHD009369 types, mainly of gastrointestinal origin. In recent years, a variety of novel interacting components and MeSHQ000502 have been identified in the MeSHD060449 revealing not only the complexity of MeSHD060449 but also its potency. Here we MeSHD014836 concentrate on the MeSHD012380 of the MeSHD060449 in MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 with emphasis placed on the molecular MeSHQ000002 known to promote neoplastic transformation in MeSHD006801 and in MeSHD023421.
43	10398760	Rescue of dysfunctional MeSHC093349 MeSHD018118 activity by MeSHD015056.	MeSHD009711-dependent gating of MeSHC093349 was evaluated in MeSHD008566 patches excised from HEK 293 and MeSHD051379 MeSHD007739 and compared to MeSHD019370 on wt-CFTR channels recorded in the same expression systems. MeSHC093349 exhibited PKA activated, MeSHD000255-dependent channel gating. When compared to wt-CFTR, the Km for MeSHD000255 was increased by ninefold (260 micron vs. 28 micron) and maximal open MeSHD011336 (Po) was reduced by 49% (0.21 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.41 +/- 0. 02). Additionally, in the absence of PKA, MeSHC093349 inactivated over a 1 to 5 min period whereas wt-CFTR remained active. MeSHD013995-dependent inactivation could be mimicked in wt-CFTR by the intermittent absence of MeSHD000255 in the cytosolic MeSHD012996. The effects of 3-isobutyl-1-methyl MeSHD019820 (MeSHD015056), a compound reported to stimulate MeSHC093349, were evaluated on wt- and MeSHC093349 channels. At concentrations up to 5 mm, MeSHD015056 caused a concentration dependent reduction in the observed single channel amplitude (i) of wt-CFTR (maximal observed reduction 35 +/- 3%). However, MeSHD015056 failed to significantly alter total patch current because of a concomitant 30% increase in Po. The effects of MeSHD015056 on MeSHC093349 were similar to effects on wt-CFTR in that i was reduced and Po was increased by similar magnitudes. Additionally, MeSHC093349 channel inactivation was dramatically slowed by MeSHD015056. These results suggest that MeSHD015056 interacts with the MeSHD000255-bound open state of CFTR to introduce a short-lived nonconducting state which prolongs burst duration and reduces apparent single channel amplitude. A MeSHQ000556 effect observed in MeSHC093349, which may result from this interaction, is a prolongation of the activated state. In MeSHD008027 of previously proposed linear kinetic models of CFTR gating, these results suggest that MeSHD015056 traps CFTR in an MeSHD000255-bound state which may preclude inactivation of MeSHC093349.
44	12271119	Dominant-negative inhibition of MeSHD011328 replication in MeSHD008822.	Our discovery of dominant-negative inhibition of MeSHD011328 formation in MeSHD002478 provided an explanation for the resistance of some MeSHD012756 to MeSHD012608 and MeSHD006801 to MeSHD007562. To determine whether dominant-negative inhibition occurs in vivo, we produced transgenic (Tg) MeSHD051379 expressing MeSHD000072002 (PrP) with either the Q167R or Q218K MeSHD009154 alone or in combination with wild-type (wt) PrP. Tg(MoPrP,Q167R)Prnp(0/0) MeSHD051379 expressing mutant PrP at levels equal to non-Tg MeSHD051379 remained healthy for >550 days, indicating that inoculation with MeSHD011328 did not cause MeSHD004194. Immunoblots of MeSHD001921 homogenates and histologic MeSHQ000032 did not reveal MeSHQ000002. Tg(MoPrP,Q167R)Prnp(+/+) MeSHD051379 expressing both mutant and wt PrP did not MeSHD020476 MeSHD009461, but their MeSHD001921 revealed low levels of the PrP pathogenic MeSHD020033 (PrP(Sc)), and sections showed numerous MeSHD014617 and severe astrocytic MeSHD005911 at 300 days after inoculation. Both Tg(MoPrP,Q218K)Prnp(0/0) and Tg(MoPrP,Q218K)Prnp(+/+) MeSHD051379 expressing high levels of the MeSHD019076 product remained healthy for >300 days after inoculation. Neither PrP(Sc) nor neuropathologic changes were found. Our studies demonstrate that although dominant-negative inhibition of wt PrP(Sc) formation occurs, expression of the dominant-negative PrP at the same level as wt PrP does not prevent MeSHD011328 formation completely. However, expression of dominant-negative PrP alone had no deleterious effects on the MeSHD051379 and did not support MeSHD011328 propagation.
45	8273924	[Comparison of MeSHD006439 effects of the MeSHD017214 and the orotracheal tube].	This MeSHD011446 was designed to compare the haemodynamic response to insertion of either a MeSHD017214 or an orotracheal tube. Twenty MeSHD010361 scheduled for orthopaedic MeSHQ000601 were randomly assigned to two groups : MeSHD017214 group (n = 10) and orotracheal tube group (n = 10). MeSHD010361 were premedicated with MeSHD005445 (1 mg i.m.) and anaesthesia was induced with MeSHD015742 (bolus of 2.5 mg.kg-1, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 mg.kg-1.h-1) and MeSHD014673 (0.1 mg.kg-1). MeSHD006339 and MeSHD062186 were assessed non-invasively before and after induction of anaesthesia and immediately after tube or MeSHD017214 insertion. Orotracheal MeSHD007440 elicited a significant increase in MeSHD006339 (92 +/- 16 vs 77 +/- 19 b.min-1, p < 0.05) and in MeSHD062186 (117 +/- 21 vs 85 +/- 16 mmHg, p < 0.05), whereas there was significant increase in MeSHD006339 (74 +/- 11 vs 72 +/- 12 b.min-1) and MeSHD062186 (86 +/- 8 vs 81 +/- 10 mmHg) after insertion of the MeSHD017214. In both groups, MeSHD010949 MeSHD002395 concentrations were not significantly modified after tube or MeSHD017214 insertion. It is concluded that, under MeSHD015742 anaesthesia, MeSHD017214 insertion does not induce any significant haemodynamic response in ASA 1 MeSHD010361. In the opposite, orotracheal MeSHD007440 increases both MeSHD006339 and MeSHD062186.
46	12942774	[Activator of MeSHD009362 in MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477, Mst1/MeSHD000071999 binds to MeSHD016159].	This study for the first MeSHD013995 demonstrates a physical and functional interaction between the Ca(2+)-MeSHD002352 Mts1/S100A4 and MeSHD009369 suppressor p53 MeSHD011506. Using different MeSHD066298 and in vivo approaches, we have found that Mts1 can bind to the C-terminal regulatory domain of p53. The Mts1 binding to p53 promotes activation of the MeSHD017930 transcription in vivo. A modulation of the p53 target MeSHD005796 (p21/WAF, bax, mdm-2, and MeSHD019700) expression was observed upon Mts1 induction in the MeSHD002477 expressing the wild-type p53. These results suggest that the MeSHD001076 of Mts1 to enhance p53-dependent MeSHD017209 of MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 MeSHD007854 to the decrease/disappearance of the MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 expressing the wild-type p53. Thus, Mts1 promotes selection of more aggressive, MeSHQ000556 MeSHD010641 during MeSHD009369 progression.
47	9787490	Spatial aspects of MeSHD005528-pad MeSHD003872 in Swedish broilers.	This study aimed at analysing spatial and spatio-temporal aspects of MeSHD005528-pad MeSHD003872 in Swedish broilers. The information on MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000453 and severity was based on a two-year MeSHD005528-MeSHD006262 MeSHQ000453 programme where information on producer, breed, feed manufacturer, region, MeSHD000003, date of slaughter and several other variables was recorded. The level of MeSHD016000 in space was analysed on 2-digit zipcode level using Moran's I test which MeSHD014894 similarity of location. The level of MeSHD016000 in space was also analysed using the Ipop test, which takes the MeSHD012307 into consideration. The examination of MeSHD013995-space interaction was carried out using the Barton MeSHD008722 and the Knox MeSHD008722. We found a significant (p < 0.001) MeSHD016000 of regions with MeSHD000078682 to MeSHD005528-pad MeSHD003872 score using Moran's I test, and a significant (p < 0.0001) MeSHD016000 in space also when related to the number of flocks delivered from each region. The flocks with very high MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD005528-pad MeSHD003872 were significantly (p < 0.05) clustered in both MeSHD013995 and space, i.e. the flocks with high MeSHQ000453 of lesions came from the same geographic area during the same MeSHD013995 periods. This information MeSHD014836 MeSHD008004 us to focus the MeSHQ000517 efforts within the MeSHD005528-MeSHD006262 MeSHQ000453 programme on specific regions in specific MeSHD013995 periods, thus making the programme more effective.
48	9160881	MeSHD015003 two-MeSHD002678 in vivo MeSHD001244 of the MeSHD019061 Lyn with the MeSHD011519 product Cbl but not with the p85 subunit of MeSHD019869.	MeSHD008024 binding of multi-chain MeSHD011946 and hematopoietin/MeSHD018121 results in rapid activation of MeSHD011505 (PTK)-dependent signalling molecules such as MeSHD058539 (MeSHD019869). Co-precipitation studies have shown that Src-related PTK, such as Lyn, associates with the p85 regulatory subunit of MeSHD019869 via SH2 and MeSHD018909 binding with their cognate MeSHD008024. More recent studies have shown that the MeSHD011519 product Cbl co-precipitates with p85 following engagement of MeSHD016207 and MeSHD011946. As opposed to MeSHD066298 co-precipitation studies, the MeSHD015003 two-MeSHD002678 screen reveals in vivo MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 interactions. Using the MeSHD015003 two-MeSHD002678 screen, we demonstrate an in vivo MeSHD001244 of Lyn's SH3 and MeSHD018909 with the MeSHD011392-rich domain of Cbl. Lyn's SH3 and MeSHD018909 do not interact with p85 in the MeSHD015003 two-MeSHD002678 screen, as would be predicted from MeSHD005982 (GST) fusion MeSHD011506 pull-down or MeSHD047468 studies from whole MeSHD002477 lysates. However, the MeSHD018909 of p85 interacts with the MeSHD011392-rich domain of Cbl. When MeSHD015003 were transformed with catalytic Lyn, an interaction between p85's MeSHD018909 and Cbl occurred. From the data, we propose the following three step process of MeSHD019869 activation: (1) complexes of Lyn-Cbl and Cbl-p85 exist without MeSHD008024 stimulation, (2) upon MeSHD008024 binding, Lyn becomes active and phosphorylates Cbl, and (3) Cbl's MeSHD014443 phosphorylated residue serves as a docking site for the MeSHD018909 of p85 - thereby stabilizing the complex and activating MeSHD019869. The MeSHD020798 can be used to dissect the precise mechanisms of in vivo MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 interactions, including those between MeSHD019000 and SH2-containing MeSHD011506.
49	9933784	A quantitative MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD002477 in the MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 layer of the chick MeSHD012160.	This study investigated the MeSHD009938 of MeSHD002477 in the MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 layer (GCL) using Nissl MeSHD013194, retrograde MeSHD002477 degeneration with MeSHD019771 of the MeSHD009900, and retrograde MeSHD002477 labeling by MeSHD007267 of MeSHD006735 (HRP) into the MeSHD009900 of chicks (posthatching day 1 and 8, P-1 and P-8). The total number of MeSHD002477 in the GCL was 6.1 x 10(6) (P-1) and 4.9 x 10(6) (P-8), and the MeSHD002452 was 14,300 MeSHD002477/mm2 (P-1) and 10,400 MeSHD002477/ mm2 (P-8) on average. Two high-density areas, the central area (CA) and the dorsal area (DA), were observed in the central and dorsal MeSHD012160 in both P-1 (22,000 MeSHD002477/mm2 in CA, 19,000 MeSHD002477/mm2 in DA) and P-8 chicks (19,000 MeSHD002477/mm2 in CA, 12,800 MeSHD002477/mm2 in DA). The MeSHD002452 in the temporal periphery (TP) and the nasal (NP) peripheral MeSHD012160 were 7,800 MeSHD002477/mm2 and 12,500 MeSHD002477/mm2, respectively, in P-1 and 5,000 MeSHD002477/ mm2 and 8,000 MeSHD002477/mm2, respectively, in P-8 chicks. The MeSHD002452 in the temporal periphery was 35% (P-8) lower than in the nasal periphery in both P-1 and P-8 chicks. Thirty percent (1.9 x 10(6) MeSHD002477 in P-1) of the total MeSHD002477 in the GCL were resistant to MeSHD019771 of the MeSHD009900. The MeSHQ000600 of the MeSHD019771-resistant MeSHD002477 showed two high-density areas in the central and dorsal MeSHD012160, corresponding to the CA (5,800 MeSHD002477/mm2) and the DA (3,200 MeSHD002477/mm2). These MeSHD002477 also exhibited a center-peripheral increase (2,200 MeSHD002477/mm2 in the TP) in P-1 chicks, but the high-density area was not found in the dorsal MeSHD012160 of P-8 chicks. From these data and the HRP study, the number of presumptive MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 in P-8 chicks was estimated to be 4 x 10(6) (8,600 MeSHD002477/mm2 on average), and the density in each area was 13,500 (CA), 10,200 (DA), and 4,300 (TP) MeSHD002477/mm2. The peripheral/ center ratios of the density of MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 were significantly different along the nasotemporal and dorsoventral axes. The density of MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 decreased more rapidly toward the temporal periphery (TP/CA ratio: 0.47 in P-1 and 0.32 in P-8) than toward the nasal periphery (NP/CA ratio: 0.67 in P-1 and 0.52 in P-8). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the peripheral/center ratios between the dorsal MeSHD012160 (DP/CA ratio: 0.6 in P-1 and 0.56 in P-8) and ventral MeSHD012160 (VP/CA ratio: 0.58 in P-1 and 0.51 in P-8). A small peak in the density of the presumptive MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 was detected in the dorsal MeSHD012160 of both P-1 chicks (10,800 MeSHD002477/mm2) and P-8 chicks (10,200 MeSHD002477/mm2). The HRP-labeled MeSHD002477 were small in the CA (M +/- SD: 35.7 +/- 9.1 microm2) and DA (40.0 +/- 11.3 microm2), and their sizes increased toward the periphery (63.4 +/- 29.7 microm2 in the TP) accompanied by a decrease in the MeSHD002452. However, the MeSHD019771-resistant MeSHD002477 did not significantly increase in size toward the peripheral MeSHD012160 (12.2 +/- 2.2 microm2 in the CA, 15.2 +/- 3.2 microm2 in the DA, 15.1 +/- 3.8 microm2 in the TP). The characteristic MeSHQ000600 of MeSHD045888 MeSHD002477 could be related to visual MeSHD001519 based upon the MeSHD013038 of avian MeSHD014794.
50	11934741	Microarray MeSHD000073458 allowing for inclusion of experiment annotations in statistical MeSHQ000032.	Microarray MeSHD013672 provides access to expression levels of thousands of MeSHD005796 at once, producing large amounts of data. These MeSHD064886 are valuable only if they are annotated by sufficiently detailed experiment descriptions. However, in many MeSHD019991 a substantial number of these annotations is in free-text format and not readily accessible to MeSHD003201-aided MeSHQ000032. The Multi-Conditional Hybridization Intensity Processing System (M-CHIPS), a MeSHD000073458 concept, focuses on providing both structure and MeSHD000465 suitable for statistical MeSHQ000032 of a microarray MeSHD019991's entire contents including the experiment annotations. It MeSHD019484 the rapid MeSHQ000254 of the amount of hybridization data, more detailed experimental descriptions, and new kinds of experiments in the MeSHD005544. We have developed a storage concept, a particular instance of which is an organism-specific MeSHD019991. Although these MeSHD019991 may contain different ontologies of experiment annotations, they share the same structure and therefore can be accessed by the very same statistical MeSHD000465. Experiment ontologies have not yet reached their final shape, and MeSHD012015 are reduced to minimal conventions that do not yet warrant extensive description. An ontology-independent structure enables updates of annotation MeSHQ000145 during normal MeSHD019991 operation without altering the structure.

51	9462346	MeSHD000535, MeSHD000544 and MeSHD001842 fragility.	The MeSHD015994 of fragility fractures has increased epidemically. Especially MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 (including MeSHD000544) have a greatly increased MeSHD012306 of fragility fractures. MeSHD000535 inhibits MeSHD002113; the greater the aluminium exposure, the higher the MeSHD012306 of an early fracture. Aluminium is neurotoxic and may, in addition to genetic factors, MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD000544 by contributing to the formation of the characteristic MeSHD016229 and MeSHD016874. Thus, a common denominator between MeSHD000544 and MeSHD001842 fragility may be a chronic low-grade MeSHD000535 intoxication. The epidemic of fragility fractures may be caused by increased aluminium exposure--due to the MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD000535 MeSHD003296 pots or the pollution acidification of our MeSHD004777. In our MeSHD010865 of 26 MeSHD006615-fracture MeSHD010361 (13 MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 and 13 individually age- and MeSHD005783-matched non-demented MeSHD010361), the MeSHD000535 content, determined mass-spectro-metrically, was higher in MeSHD000071556 MeSHQ000473 from the MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 than from the non-demented MeSHD010361 (p = 0.005). The MeSHD000535 content was also higher in the younger of the 26 MeSHD010361 (p = 0.02). Our MeSHQ000175 agree with the hypothesis that MeSHD000535 MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD000544 and MeSHD001842 fragility.
52	7963640	Spontaneous MeSHD013161: an uncommon complication of MeSHD003586.	A previously healthy 25-year-old man developed a MeSHD012422 of the MeSHD013154 during a MeSHD003587 (CMV) MeSHD007239. The only other clinical feature was a well tolerated MeSHD005334 of 37.5 degrees C to 39 degrees C during the month before. The MeSHD003933 was confirmed by the presence of MeSHD007075 to CMV in the MeSHD044967 and by typical MeSHD045586 for CMV identified by splenic histopathological MeSHQ000175. The MeSHD010361 recovered completely. Spontaneous MeSHD013161 is uncommon in primary MeSHD003586.
53	9614173	Immunoisolation and characterization of a subdomain of the MeSHD004721 that concentrates MeSHD011506 involved in COPII vesicle biogenesis.	MeSHD012412 E1 MeSHD006023 normally complexes with E2 in the MeSHD004721 (ER) to MeSHD020478 a heterodimer that is transported to and retained in the MeSHD006056. In a previous study, we showed that in the absence of E2, unassembled E1 subunits accumulate in a tubular pre-Golgi compartment whose MeSHQ000033 and biochemical properties are distinct from both rough ER and Golgi. We hypothesized that this compartment corresponds to hypertrophied ER exit sites that have expanded in response to overexpression of E1. In the present study we constructed BHK MeSHD002477 stably expressing E1 MeSHD011506 containing a cytoplasmically disposed MeSHD000939 and isolated the pre-Golgi compartment from these MeSHD002477 by MeSHD002458 and immunoisolation. Double label MeSHD019084 in MeSHD002477 and MeSHD015151 of immunoisolated tubular networks revealed that MeSHD011506 involved in formation of ER-derived MeSHD022161, namely p58/ERGIC 53, Sec23p, and Sec13p, were concentrated in the E1-containing pre-Golgi compartment. Furthermore, budding structures were evident in these MeSHD008566 profiles, and a highly abundant but unknown 65-kDa MeSHD011506 was also present. By comparison, marker MeSHD011506 of the rough ER, Golgi, and MeSHD020755 vesicles were not enriched in these MeSHD008566. These results demonstrate that the composition of the tubular networks corresponds to that expected of ER exit sites. Accordingly, we propose the MeSHD009275 SEREC (smooth ER exit compartment) for this structure.

The experiments were carried out on MeSHD008297 MeSHD051381 with different MeSHD012680 to alcohol. To assess MeSHD012680 to MeSHD000431 effects, we have used MeSHD000431-induced MeSHD012890 MeSHD013995 and variations in rectal MeSHD013696 of alcohol-intoxicated MeSHD000818. Activity of MeSHD000426, MeSHC092153, MeSHD002374 and MeSHD000444 in the MeSHD008099 as well as MeSHD000431 and MeSHD000079 levels in the MeSHQ000097 were determined after alcohol intoxication (3.5 g/kg, i.p., 8 days). The MeSHQ000254 of alcohol tolerance was accompanied by induction of the MeSHC092153 in long-sleeping MeSHD051381 and in short-sleeping MeSHD051381 as well as by an increase in MeSHD000431 and MeSHD000079 levels in the MeSHQ000097.
55	9839869	Compartmentalization of Th1/Th2 MeSHD016207 responses to experimental MeSHD015011 MeSHD007239 in MeSHD002415.	MeSHD013047 MeSHD002415 were inoculated subcutaneously into the MeSHD004322 areas of the left auricular and popliteal MeSHD008198 with living MeSHD015011. MeSHD007249 was evident at the inoculation sites and the regional MeSHD008198 were palpably enlarged at 48 h post-MeSHD007239. MeSHD008198 enlargement was due to marked paracortical lymphoid MeSHD006965 and variable MeSHD009504 infiltrates. MeSHD015007 was cultured from the regional MeSHD008198 and/or MeSHD013154 of three of the six MeSHD002415, indicating systemic spread of MeSHQ000382. Specific T-helper 1 and 2 (Th1, Th2) MeSHD002477-associated MeSHD016207 MeSHD012333 levels were compared in regional MeSHD008198, MeSHD007963 (PBMC) and MeSHD013154 at 48 h post-inoculation. Relative to unstimulated MeSHQ000517 MeSHD014024, there was a significant increase in MeSHD014409, IFN-gamma, MeSHD018664, and MeSHD016753 MeSHD012333 in MeSHD013154 with MeSHD015536 of MeSHD015847. Significant MeSHD015854 of MeSHD014409 and MeSHD015536 of MeSHD015847 were also observed in PBMC. Paradoxically, 48 h stimulated MeSHD008198 showed only minimal differences in MeSHD016207 MeSHD012333 expression when compared to MeSHD008198 from mock-inoculated MeSHQ000517 MeSHD000818 or unchallenged contralateral MeSHD008198 from the same MeSHD000818. This study demonstrated that MeSHD002415, like MeSHD051379, respond to an intracellular pathogen such as Y pseudotuberculosis with a predominantly Th1-type MeSHD007109. The MeSHD016207 responses in regional MeSHD008198 and MeSHD013154 were asynchronous, while MeSHD016207 stimulation in MeSHD002477 of the MeSHD013154 was mirrored by PBMC.
56	11371348	MeSHD005680 itself promotes the developmental switch of neuronal GABAergic responses from excitation to inhibition.	MeSHD005680 is the main inhibitory MeSHD018377 in the MeSHD000328 MeSHD001921. Early in MeSHQ000254, however, GABAergic MeSHD009435 is excitatory and can exert widespread trophic effects. During the postnatal period, GABAergic responses undergo a switch from being excitatory to inhibitory. Here, we show that the switch is delayed by chronic blockade of MeSHD011963, and accelerated by increased MeSHD011963 activation. In contrast, blockade of glutamatergic MeSHQ000635 or MeSHD000200 has no effect. Furthermore, GABAergic activity modulated the MeSHD012333 levels of KCC2, a K(+)-Cl(-) MeSHD027981 whose expression correlates with the switch. Finally, we MeSHD058028 that MeSHD005680 can alter the properties of depolarization-induced Ca(2+) influx. Thus, MeSHD005680 acts as a MeSHD004532-limiting trophic factor during neural MeSHQ000254.
57	9631259	Fusion expression of MeSHD049452 and HCV MeSHD002213 antigene in MeSHD004926 MeSHD002477.	A chimeric MeSHD005796 of the MeSHD049452 (GFP) and MeSHD016174 (HCV) core antigene were constructed and expressed in E. coli MeSHD002477. The expressed fusion MeSHD011506 was examined by Dot-MeSHD004797 and MeSHD015153 and the three MeSHD000939 were detected. The GFP-Core fusion MeSHD011506 showed not only the striking green MeSHD005453 under natural MeSHD008027 but also the HCV antigenic activity. A new MeSHD008722 of MeSHD007159 is greatly anticipated in the MeSHD008027 of this fusion MeSHD011506 which can be seen as the HCV MeSHD000941 tagged with the MeSHD049452.
58	9990005	Receptor-induced MeSHD058105 of coatomer.	Coatomer, the coat MeSHD011506 complex of MeSHD020755 vesicles, is involved in the budding of these vesicles, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Toward a better MeSHD032882 of this process, the interaction between coatomer and the cytoplasmic domain of a major transmembrane MeSHD011506 of MeSHD020755 vesicles, p23, was studied. Interaction of coatomer with this MeSHD000072417 results in a conformational change and MeSHD058105 of the complex MeSHD066298. This changed conformation also is observed in vivo, i.e., on the surface of authentic, isolated MeSHD020755 vesicles. An average of four MeSHD010455 was found associated with one coatomer complex after MeSHD058105. Based on these results, we propose a mechanism by which the induced conformational change of coatomer results in its MeSHD058105, and thus MeSHD004328 formation of the bud on the Golgi MeSHD008566 during biogenesis of a MeSHD020755 vesicle.
59	10655498	Toward a MeSHD060066 of the MeSHD004718: A comprehensive system to examine two-MeSHD002678 interactions in all possible combinations between the MeSHD005656.	"MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 interactions MeSHD010988 pivotal MeSHD012380 in various aspects of the structural and functional MeSHD009938 of the MeSHD002477, and their complete description is indispensable to thorough MeSHD032882 of the MeSHD002477. As an approach toward this MeSHD006040, here we MeSHD058028 a comprehensive system to examine two-MeSHD002678 interactions in all of the possible combinations between MeSHD011506 of MeSHD012441. We cloned all of the MeSHD015003 MeSHD016366 individually as a MeSHD004247-binding domain fusion (""bait"") in a MATa MeSHD013180 and as an activation domain fusion (""prey"") in a MATalpha MeSHD013180, and subsequently divided them into pools, each containing 96 MeSHD002999. These bait and prey MeSHD002999 pools were systematically mated with each other, and the transformants were subjected to strict selection for the activation of three MeSHD017930 followed by sequence tagging. Our initial examination of approximately 4 x 10(6) different combinations, constituting approximately 10% of the total to be tested, has revealed 183 independent two-MeSHD002678 interactions, more than half of which are entirely novel. Notably, the obtained binary data allow us to extract more complex interaction networks, including the one that may explain a currently unsolved mechanism for the connection between distinct steps of vesicular transport. The approach described here thus MeSHD014836 provide many MeSHD007854 for integration of various cellular MeSHQ000502 and serve as a major driving force in the completion of the MeSHD060066."
60	11257031	MeSHD004247 transformation of MeSHD018314 axenic amastigotes and their MeSHQ000706 in MeSHD004353.	Protocols for MeSHD004247 MeSHD018274 in MeSHD007891 promastigote MeSHD002477 are well established. More recently, MeSHD066298 MeSHQ000208 of axenic MeSHD007891 amastigotes became possible. We have established conditions for MeSHD004247 transformation of axenically grown MeSHD018314 amastigotes. Parameters for MeSHD004247 MeSHD018274 of MeSHD007891 axenic amastigotes were systematically studied using MeSHD008156-mediated MeSHD014171 MeSHD014162. MeSHD002460 expressing stable MeSHD008156 activity were then selected, and their MeSHD001076 to be used in an MeSHD066298 MeSHD004353 MeSHD008722 was determined. A model was established, using axenic amastigotes expressing MeSHD008156 activity, for rapidly determining the activity of MeSHD004364 directly against both axenic and intracellular amastigotes. For intracellular amastigotes, the 50% effective concentrations of MeSHD010419, MeSHD000967 (MeSHD000967), MeSHD008536 (MeSHD000077485), and MeSHD011188 antimonyl MeSHC029768 determined with the MeSHD008156 MeSHQ000032 were 0.2 microM (0.12 microg/ml), 55 microg/ml, 95 microg/ml, and 0.12 microg/ml, respectively; these values are in agreement with values determined by more labor-intensive MeSHD013194 MeSHQ000379. We also showed the usefulness of MeSHD008156-expressing MeSHQ000469 for analyzing MeSHD004351. The availability of MeSHD008156-expressing amastigotes for MeSHQ000706 in MeSHD057166 should facilitate the search for new antileishmanial MeSHD004364.
61	11672589	MeSHD018817 (MeSHD018817; 'Ecstasy') suppresses MeSHD000941 specific IgG2a and IFN-gamma MeSHD004467.	"Methylenedioxymethiamphetamine (MeSHD018817; ""Ecstasy"") is a widely abused MeSHD000661 derivative. In the present study, we examined the effect of acute MeSHD018817 MeSHD009934 on an MeSHD000941 specific MeSHD007109. Responsiveness to an in vivo challenge with the soluble MeSHD011506 MeSHD000941 MeSHC032808 (KLH) was examined in MeSHD051381 following MeSHD018817 MeSHD009934 (2.5, 5 or 10 mg/kg; i.p.). KLH-specific MeSHD044967 MeSHD007075 concentrations were measured 7 days following challenge, and MeSHD044967 MeSHD007074 concentrations were measured 14 days following the KLH challenge. In addition, MeSHD000941-specific IFN-gamma and MeSHD015850 MeSHD004467 was measured in KLH-stimulated splenocytes. MeSHD018817 did not alter the KLH-specific MeSHD007075 response. In contrast, MeSHD018817 (5 and 10 mg/kg) provoked a significant suppression of KLH-specific MeSHD007074 MeSHD004467. Thus, MeSHD018817 MeSHD009934 did not alter the initial generation of the MeSHD000917 but rather inhibited MeSHD007132 switching from MeSHD007075 to MeSHD007074. Two pathways for the genetic switch from MeSHD007075 to MeSHD007074 MeSHD004467 were investigated. One pathway requires the Th(1) type MeSHD016207 IFN-gamma to stimulate MeSHD007075-secreting MeSHD002477 to switch to MeSHD007074(2a)-secreting MeSHD002477. Another pathway requires the Th(2) type MeSHD016207 MeSHD015847 and MeSHD015850 to stimulate MeSHD007075-secreting MeSHD002477 to switch to MeSHD007074(1)-secreting MeSHD002477. MeSHD007074(1) and MeSHD007074(2a) levels were measured to determine if these two pathways were differentially affected. The results indicate that only MeSHD007074(2a) levels were decreased following MeSHD018817 MeSHD009934. Furthermore, this decrease in MeSHD007074(2a) was accompanied by decreased KLH-specific IFN-gamma MeSHD004467 14 days post KLH MeSHD009934. In conclusion, these data indicate that MeSHD018817 alters the MeSHD001076 to switch from MeSHD007075 to MeSHD007074(2a) MeSHD004467, possibly by reducing IFN-gamma. Potential MeSHD006262 consequences for MeSHD018817 users are discussed."
62	14518291	[A new pathophysiologic concept in MeSHD050500: MeSHD014024 destruction induced via inflammatory mediators].	In the present study we analyzed the three MeSHD054467 MeSHD020033 MeSHD054467 type I (MeSHC415667-I), MeSHD054467 type II (MeSHD054501), MeSHD054467 type IV (MeSHD054513) in MeSHD050500 in comparison with normal MeSHD010179. MeSHC415667-I also named pancreatic MeSHD010740 is a digestive MeSHD004798 while MeSHD054501 and MeSHD054513 MeSHD010988 an important MeSHQ000502 in inflammatory reactions. In MeSHD050500 MeSHC415667-I MeSHD012333 expression was significantly reduced. In contrast, MeSHD054501 and MeSHD054513 MeSHD012333 were increased in 73% of the MeSHD050500 samples (MeSHD054501; 5.7-fold overexpressed; MeSHD054513:5.1-fold overexpressed; p < 0.05). By MeSHD017403 the highest expression signals were found in MeSHD050500 samples in areas with ductal MeSHD008679. MeSHD007150 of MeSHD054501 revealed also the strongest immunoreactivity in ductal MeSHD008679. Increased MeSHD054501 and MeSHD054513 MeSHD012333 levels were associated with a higher degree of MeSHD014024 destruction, ductal MeSHD008679 and degree of MeSHD005355. Our MeSHQ000175 indicate that MeSHD054501 and MeSHD054513 seems to MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in the pathobiological alterations in MeSHD050500 and contribute to the morphological changes which occur in MeSHD050500.
63	10191111	Intracellular trafficking of the JNCL MeSHD011506 CLN3.	MeSHD009472 is a MeSHD016464 that MeSHQ000209 MeSHD014786, progressive MeSHD060825, and eventually MeSHD003643. A predominant 1.02-kb deletion as well as other MeSHD009154 have been described in the CLN3 MeSHD005796. Lacking significant identity with MeSHD011506 of known MeSHQ000502 and no overt targeting signals within the primary MeSHD000595, accurate predictions of the intracellular location and MeSHQ000502 could not be made. Further, recent conflicting MeSHD058028 identified CLN3 as either a lysosomal or a MeSHD024101. MeSHD014162 experiments using native and MeSHD000939-tagged fusion MeSHD011506 were evaluated to help delineate CLN3 localization. We confirmed by MeSHD007150 and MeSHD020126 MeSHQ000628 that NH2-terminal green MeSHD005453 MeSHD011506 (GFP)-CLN3 fusion MeSHD011506 were retained in the MeSHD006056, with no colocalization with mitochondrial markers. Anti-CLN3 MeSHD000906 directed against MeSHD000596 67-90 of CLN3 were generated and shown to be specific for a 50-kDa MeSHD011506 in MeSHD057809 and GFP-CLN3 in transfected MeSHD002477. However, MeSHD002477 transfected with nontagged CLN3 or carboxyl-terminal-tagged CLN3 were not immunoreactive with anti-CLN3 MeSHD000906, suggesting that normally, the amino terminus interacts with other molecules. Thus, tags on the NH2-terminus probably inhibited these interactions and MeSHD009068 of CLN3 from the Golgi to more distal compartments. Also, CLN3 tagged at the COOH-terminus with either GFP or FLAG MeSHD000939 were retained in the ER, indicating a MeSHD012380 for the COOH-terminus in trafficking. Taken together, these data confirm that CLN3 traffics through the ER and Golgi.

It remains to be determined whether the MeSHD005091 17 C/T MeSHD020641 is the susceptibility MeSHD020641 for PCOS or whether it is in MeSHD015810 with another INSR MeSHD011110.
65	12777642	MeSHD011506 interaction for an MeSHD007372-inducible systemic lupus associated MeSHD005796, IFIT1.	To identify MeSHD004194-related MeSHD005796 and immune-regulatory pathways in the MeSHQ000209 of MeSHD008180 (SLE) by using MeSHD020869 and MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 interaction MeSHQ000032. Peripheral MeSHD007962 MeSHD059467 of 10 SLE MeSHD010361 were determined by MeSHD020411 MeSHQ000032. MeSHD016000 of the MeSHD059467 was compared with the clinical immune MeSHD010641. SLE-induced MeSHD005796 that were over- or under-expressed were determined and independently validated using a MeSHD060888 (MeSHD016133) MeSHD008722. To study their potential MeSHQ000502 and the possible pathways involved, a candidate MeSHD005796 was cloned and a GST (MeSHD005982) fusion MeSHD011506 was expressed in MeSHD004926. The fusion MeSHD011506 was further purified using the MeSHD005978 MeSHD012685 system, and was treated as bait to capture prey from SLE peripheral MeSHD007962 lysate. MeSHD019032-TOF (matrix-assisted MeSHD007834 desorption/ionization-MeSHD013995-of-flight) MeSHD013058 was then performed to determine the prey MeSHD011506. Similarity was found between the MeSHD059467 and the immune MeSHD010641 clusters of the SLE MeSHD010361. More than 20 MeSHD004194-associated MeSHD005796 were identified, some of which have not been related to SLE previously. Of these MeSHD005796, a cluster of MeSHD007372-induced MeSHD005796 were highly correlated. IFIT1 (MeSHD007372-induced with MeSHD000074436 1) was one of these MeSHD005796, and overexpression of its MeSHD012333 was confirmed independently by MeSHD060888 in a larger MeSHD011153 (40 SLE MeSHD010361 and 29 normal MeSHQ000517). An IFIT1 MeSHD011506- MeSHD011506 interaction study showed that IFIT1 may interact with Rho/Rac MeSHD020662. The MeSHD059467 seems to be the molecular basis of the diverse immune MeSHD010641 of SLE. On the basis of the SLE-related MeSHD005796 found in this study, we suggest that the MeSHD007372-related immune pathway is important in the MeSHQ000209 of SLE. IFIT1 is the first MeSHD005796 described as a candidate MeSHD005796 for SLE, and may MeSHQ000502 by activating Rho MeSHD011506 through interaction with Rho/Rac MeSHD020662. IFIT1 and the MeSHD007372-related pathway may provide potential targets for novel interventions in the MeSHQ000628 of SLE.

MeSHQ000002 in this MeSHQ000517 induce MeSHD003681 of airway surface liquid, which results in recurring bronchopulmonary MeSHD007239, and increases in Na and Cl concentrations in MeSHD013542, which constitutes the rationale for the MeSHD013542 test. CFTR also participates in the MeSHD012926 of MeSHD007249. Over one thousand MeSHD009154 in the CFTR MeSHD005796 have been reported, the most frequent of which is the absence of the MeSHD010649 residue at MeSHD000596 position 508 (delta F508)."
67	7854061	MeSHQ000032 of the hippocampal MeSHD011963 system in kindled MeSHD051381 by autoradiographic and MeSHD017403 MeSHQ000379: contingent tolerance to MeSHD002220.	Tolerance to the MeSHD000927 effects of MeSHD002220 (CBZ) in the MeSHD000679 kindling paradigm is a contingent process, since it only develops in MeSHD051381 treated with CBZ before the kindling stimulation and not in those MeSHD000818 treated after the stimulation. The present study was designed to investigate the MeSHD011963 system in CBZ contingent tolerance. Receptor MeSHD001345 utilizing various radioligands that bind to different components of the MeSHD011963 system and MeSHD017403 with MeSHD009841 that recognize different subunits of the MeSHD011963 were performed. Kindling increased binding to MeSHD001569, MeSHD010852, and MeSHD005680 recognition sites selectively in the MeSHD018891 of the MeSHD006624. Kindling also increased levels of MeSHD012333 for the alpha 4, beta 1, and beta 3 subunits but did not change alpha 1, alpha 2, or gamma 2 subunit levels. MeSHD051381 tolerant to CBZ showed decreased [3H]MeSHD009118 binding, MeSHD003975-insensitive [3H]MeSHC042957 binding, and decreased alpha 4 subunit MeSHD012333 content compared to non-tolerant MeSHD051381, whereas [3H]MeSHD005445 binding, [35S]MeSHC037476 binding, and the levels of beta 1, and beta 3 subunit MeSHD012333 remained elevated. The data suggest an indirect interaction of CBZ with the MeSHD011963 system, since CBZ reportedly does not bind to this receptor system.
68	10827797	[MeSHD000544: is MeSHD042241 significant?].	"ADVANTAGES OF EARLY DIAGNOSIS: Better MeSHD011379 and MeSHD011788 for MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 and their MeSHD017028 depends on MeSHD042241 as specific MeSHQ000628 (MeSHD002800) early in the MeSHD004194 process can have a beneficial effect on MeSHD003071 and psychiatric or behavioral disorders. In addition MeSHD042241 gives the MeSHD010820 the opportunity to provide adapted advice for the MeSHD010361 and MeSHD017028 especially important in preventing MeSHQ000150 and helping the MeSHD005190 cope with the inevitable disruption of the MeSHD005190 pattern caused by the MeSHD004194, a situation which is particularly for the ""designated MeSHD017028"". PREDEMENTIA STATES: The question of MeSHD042241 raises several types of problems. Defining the limits of the MeSHD004194 is particularly difficult: when does MeSHD000544 start? what is the definition of predementia? A growing body of MeSHD014937 suggests that it is warranted to identify MeSHD010361 at MeSHD012306 of developing MeSHD000544 since, according to certain authors, they can benefit from specific MeSHQ000628. RISK FACTORS: The only fully recognized MeSHD012307 are age, MeSHD005190 MeSHQ000266 of MeSHD003704 and presence of the MeSHD000483 epsilon 4 of the MeSHD001053 E MeSHD005796. There are probably several other MeSHD012307. Their identification is a current subject of debate. TOOLS FOR EARLY DIAGNOSIS: MeSHD011594 tests have been shown to provide specific information useful for interpreting the clinical assessment which must focus on detecting early MeSHQ000175 and exploring even minimal MeSHD008568 MeSHQ000172."
69	9646714	[182 offspring of MeSHD002417 with MeSHD016643 (BSE) in MeSHD013557. 2. MeSHD004813 and pathological MeSHQ000175].	In order to detect lesions of a spongiform MeSHD001927 and/or accumulation of the MeSHD010447 resistant MeSHD000072002 (MeSHD018620), 182 offspring of MeSHD002417 affected with BSE were examined neuropathological and immunohistochemically. Neither spongiform MeSHD001927 nor MeSHD018620 accumulation were found. In seven MeSHD000818 other neuropathological lesions were seen, significant ones in three. Because of the small MeSHD012306 of exposure to contaminated feed in these MeSHD000818, nearly all of which were born after the introduction of the MeSHD011506 feed ban for MeSHD012418, the MeSHQ000453 of spongiform MeSHD001927 in this series of BSE offspring would be suggestive of maternal MeSHQ000635. However, the value of the study in this MeSHD000078682 is quite limited. Only half of the MeSHD000818 were old enough to develop clinical and pathological evidence of the MeSHD004194. If a MeSHD000072741 on the MeSHD012306 for the offspring is only to be expected during the last 6 months of the incubation of the dam as suggested by British investigations, only few MeSHD000818 in this study would MeSHC046503 the requirement of having been born during this critical period. Since it cannot be entirely excluded that the BSE agent transiently invades extraneural MeSHD014024 in the early stages of MeSHD007239, the above mentioned restriction to the final 6 months of the incubation MeSHD013995 of the dam would not necessarily be applicable to all situations. We concluded that this study supports previous MeSHD019370 according to which maternal MeSHQ000635 of BSE is at best a rare event.
70	14562038	The Chfr MeSHD059566 MeSHD011506 MeSHQ000502 with Ubc13-Mms2 to MeSHD020478 Lys63-linked MeSHD025821 chains.	We recently described a novel checkpoint pathway that MeSHQ000502 early in MeSHD008938 to delay MeSHD002875 condensation in response to MeSHD008870 MeSHD011042. The only MeSHD005796 implicated so far in this checkpoint pathway is chfr, whose MeSHD011506 product contains a RING domain and has MeSHD025801 MeSHD008025 activity MeSHD066298. The significance of this activity in vivo is unclear. A recent MeSHD058028 suggested that the Chfr MeSHD011506 targets itself for MeSHD046988-dependent MeSHQ000378 in mitotic MeSHD002477 through autoubiquitination. However, we observe that in MeSHD008938 Chfr MeSHD020476 a MeSHD010766-dependent electrophoretic mobility shift with no change in MeSHD016424 MeSHD011506 levels. Further MeSHQ000032 of its MeSHD025801 MeSHD008025 activity revealed that Chfr can catalyse the formation of noncanonical Lys63-linked MeSHD025821 chains with Ubc13-Mms2 acting as the MeSHD044763. Ubc13-Mms2 and Lys63-MeSHD025821 chains are not associated with targeting MeSHD011506 to the MeSHD046988, but rather with signaling cellular stress. We propose that Chfr may have a MeSHD012380 in signaling the presence of mitotic stress induced by MeSHD008870 MeSHD011042.
71	10613599	Achiral and chiral MeSHD002851 MeSHQ000032 of MeSHC016904 and its metabolites in microsomal samples.	Achiral and chiral MeSHD002851 (MeSHD002851) were developed for monitoring MeSHC016904 and its two metabolites in MeSHD066298 microsomal samples. MeSHC016904 is a chiral MeSHD004364 with the same MeSHD001076 as MeSHD014700 in reversing MDR (MeSHD018432) against some MeSHD054697. R(+) MeSHC016904 is less cardiotoxic as S(-) enantiomer and so it could be applied in higher concentrations. MeSHD002851 conditions were worked out for both achiral and chiral assays and very simple and effective preseparation MeSHD008722 (SPE - MeSHD052616) was used for microsomal sample as clean-up step before MeSHD002851 MeSHQ000032. The total concentrations of MeSHC016904 and its metabolites were calculated from achiral chromatograms and the ratio of enantiomers were determined from chiral MeSHD004243. The complete MeSHQ000032 could be used for both MeSHD066298 and in vivo experiments.
72	7969072	MeSHD016297 of N-linked MeSHD006031 sites on the MeSHD005680 type A receptor alpha 1 subunit.	MeSHD016297 was used to mutate the two potential sites for N-linked MeSHD006031 on the MeSHD051381 MeSHD005680 (MeSHD005680)A receptor alpha 1 subunit. Wild-type (WT) or mutant alpha 1 subunits [MeSHD001216 to MeSHD005973 substitutions at position 10 (alpha 1Q10), 110 (alpha 1Q110), or both 10 and 110 (alpha 1Q10/110)] were coexpressed with beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits in MeSHD014981 MeSHD009865. Removal of either one or both potential sites for N-linked MeSHD006031 resulted in expression, in MeSHD014981 MeSHD009865, of functional MeSHD011963 with pharmacological properties similar to those observed for the WT receptor. WT and mutant alpha 1 subunits were co-transfected with beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits in MeSHD006801 embryonic MeSHD007668 293 MeSHD002477. WT and mutant alpha 1 subunits expressed in 293 MeSHD002477 were photoaffinity labeled with [3H]MeSHD005445. Co-MeSHD014162 of alpha 1WT, alpha 1Q10, or alpha 1Q110 subunits in combination with beta 1 and gamma 2 MeSHD011963 subunits resulted in the labeling of single bands, with approximate molecular masses of 54, 49, and 50 kDa, respectively. The decrease in molecular mass for both the alpha 1Q10 and alpha 1Q110 mutants suggests that both MeSHD016384 for N-linked MeSHD006031 are used in 293 MeSHD002477. Low levels of [3H]MeSHD005445 binding prevented visualization of the alpha 1Q10/110 double mutant. The 293 MeSHD002477 transfected with either the alpha 1Q10 or alpha 1Q110 mutant in combination with beta 1 and gamma 2 subunits expressed significantly lower levels of [3H]MeSHD005442 binding, relative to WT levels. In addition, [3H]MeSHD005442 binding was undetectable in 293 MeSHD002477 expressing the alpha 1Q10/110 double mutant. When transfected 293 MeSHD002477 were grown at 30 zero, [3H]MeSHD005442 binding to alpha 1Q10 and alpha 1Q110 MeSHD011963 was restored to levels comparable to that for WT receptors. [3H]MeSHD005442 binding to alpha 1Q10/110 was not reliably detected at 30 zero. Similar results were observed using [3H]MeSHD009118. These data suggest that intracellular processing and transport of the MeSHD006031-deficient MeSHD011963 alpha 1 subunit is MeSHD013696 sensitive. Furthermore, the observed differences between the two expression systems may be accounted for by the typically lower MeSHD013696 used for maintaining microinjected MeSHD014981 MeSHD009865. Thus, although MeSHD006031 is not an absolute requirement for MeSHD011963 expression, it has a profound effect on the processing of at least the alpha 1 receptor and its subsequent assembly into a mature receptor.
73	12231540	MeSHD009369-infiltrating MeSHD008264 are involved in suppressing MeSHQ000254 and MeSHD009362 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD011471 MeSHD002477 by INF-beta MeSHD015316 in MeSHD008819.	This study was to determine the MeSHD012380 of MeSHD009369-infiltrating MeSHD008264 in IFN-beta-induced host defense against MeSHD011471. Efficacy of MeSHD000256-mediated IFN-beta MeSHD015316 against orthotopic MeSHD064593 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD011471 was tested in MeSHD008264-compromised MeSHD008819. MeSHD007150 and MeSHD015152 were used to elucidate mechanisms responsible for the IFN-beta MeSHD015316. PC-3MM2 MeSHD006801 MeSHD011471 MeSHD002477 were inoculated into the MeSHD011467 of MeSHD008819. MeSHD015552 of an adenoviral vector-encoding MeSHD051189 IFN-beta (AdmIFN-beta) but not MeSHQ000517 vector AdE/1 suppressed MeSHQ000254 of PC-3MM2 MeSHD009369 in a dose-dependent manner, with a maximal reduction of MeSHD047368 by approximately 85% at 2 x 10(9) plaque-forming units. The MeSHQ000628 prevented MeSHD009362, eradicated established MeSHD009362 in some MeSHD051379, and prolonged the MeSHD013534 of MeSHD009369-bearing MeSHD051379. The efficacy of AdmIFN-beta MeSHQ000628 was reduced significantly in MeSHD051379 treated with MeSHD008264-selective anti-Mac-1 and anti-Mac-2 MeSHD000906. Moreover, the i.p. MeSHD007267 of the MeSHD000906 restored the tumorigenicity of PC-3MM2 MeSHD002477 stably engineered with MeSHD051189 IFN-beta MeSHD005796. MeSHD009369-infiltrating MeSHD008264, significantly increased in AdmIFN-beta-injected lesions, were depleted by the MeSHD000906. The MeSHQ000628 stimulated expression of the MeSHD052247, down-regulated MeSHD053773 and MeSHD016209, reduced MeSHD000082644, and resulted in MeSHD017209 of MeSHD042783 in the lesions. These effects of AdmIFN-beta were partially diminished in MeSHD051379 treated with the MeSHD000906. These data suggest that MeSHD008264 MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in IFN-beta MeSHD015316 and that intralesional delivery of the IFN-beta MeSHD005796 could be an effective MeSHQ000628 for clinically localized MeSHD006801 MeSHD011471.
74	7472445	Multiple presynaptic MeSHD018094 modulate excitatory and inhibitory MeSHD009435 in hippocampal area CA1.	The MeSHD018094 (mGluRs) have many important MeSHD012380 in MeSHD012926 of neuronal excitability and MeSHD009435. In hippocampal area CA1, activation of mGluRs can reduce both excitatory and inhibitory MeSHD009435. The conventional view is that the presynaptic effects are mediated by L-MeSHC012729 (MeSHC114785)-sensitive, or group III mGluRs (MeSHC108823, mGluR6, MeSHC102719, mGluR8). However, some studies suggest that other mGluR subtypes may also be involved in MeSHD012926 of excitatory and inhibitory MeSHD009435 in area CA1. We have found that two pharmacologically distinct MeSHD017661 are involved in the MeSHD003863 of excitatory MeSHQ000635 at the MeSHD006624--CA1 MeSHD013569. Consistent with previous studies, one receptor subtype is an MeSHC114785-sensitive receptor that is pharmacologically similar to MeSHC108823 or MeSHC102719. However, we have found that a second mGluR subtype, which is pharmacologically similar to MeSHC104077 and mGluR5 (group I mGluRs), can also reduce excitatory MeSHD009435 in area CA1. MeSHQ000032 of effects of MeSHQ000819 of these two receptors on miniature EPSCs and paired-MeSHD011674 facilitation suggest that both receptors are localized presynaptically. It is also shown that the mGluR that reduces MeSHQ000635 at inhibitory MeSHD013569 in area CA1 is presynaptically localized, is insensitive to MeSHC114785, and is sensitive to MeSHQ000819 selective for MeSHC104077 and mGluR5.
75	10477825	Enzymatic properties of MeSHD051381 group IIA and V MeSHD010741(2) compared.	Group IIA and V MeSHD010741(2) (PLA(2)s) are known to MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in inflammatory responses. We have constructed a bacterial expression vector for MeSHD051381 group IIA and V PLA(2)s, over-expressed, folded and purified the MeSHD011506 with the aim to study and compare the properties of the MeSHD004798 in detail. For zwitterionic MeSHD010743 MeSHD008823, both MeSHD004798 display optimum activity at MeSHD006863 8. 0 and absolutely require Ca(2+) for enzymatic activity. In the presence of substrate, group V PLA(2) has a high affinity for Ca(2+) (K(Ca2+)=90 microM) while K(Ca2+) of group IIA PLA(2) was found to be 1.6 mM. The absence of substrate only marginally influences the Ca(2+) affinities. In contrast to group IIA PLA(2), group V PLA(2) does not show a jump in the activity profile at substrate concentrations around the critical MeSHD008823 concentration. Direct binding studies using n-alkylphosphocholines indicate that group V PLA(2) MeSHD020478 MeSHD011506-MeSHD008055 aggregates at pre-micellar MeSHD008055 concentrations in a cooperative and Ca(2+)-dependent manner. This MeSHD001519, which is comparable to that observed for the PLA(2) from MeSHD000073156 melanoleuca MeSHD012910, reflects the high affinity of this MeSHD004798 for zwitterionic MeSHD010743. Competitive inhibition by the substrate analogues (R)-2-dodecanoylaminohexanol-1-MeSHD010767 and its phosphoglycol derivative was tested on zwitterionic MeSHD008823 as substrate. Group IIA PLA(2) shows a preference for the phosphoglycol inhibitor whereas the MeSHD010767 inhibitor binds stronger to the MeSHD020134 of group V PLA(2). The enzymatic activity was also measured on zwitterionic MeSHD008081 which appear to be much better substrates for group V PLA(2) than for group IIA PLA(2). The MeSHD016424 results suggest that group V PLA(2) is better suited for action on MeSHD001688 MeSHD008566 than group IIA PLA(2).
76	7703349	Structure and MeSHQ000502 of a molecular machine: MeSHD003576.	MeSHD045304 is responsible for over 90% of the MeSHD010100 MeSHD004467 in the living MeSHD002477 and contributes to the build-up of a MeSHD011522 electrochemical gradient derived by the vectorial transfer of MeSHD004583 between MeSHD045304 and molecular MeSHD010100. The MeSHD008670 MeSHD007477 found in MeSHD003576 MeSHD010988 a crucial MeSHD012380 in these processes and have been extensively studied. In this MeSHD016454 we present and discuss some of the relevant spectroscopic and kinetic properties of the prosthetic groups of MeSHD003576.
77	12354289	Inhibition of MeSHD014365 activity and decreased MeSHD044282 binding in a MeSHD051379 model of MeSHD006816.	The pathogenic mechanisms of the mutant MeSHD000071058 that cause MeSHD006816 (HD) are unknown. Previous studies have reported significant decreases in the levels of MeSHD012701 (MeSHD012701) and its metabolite 5-MeSHD006897 (MeSHD006897) in the MeSHD001921 of the R6/2 MeSHD008822 model of HD. In an attempt to elucidate the cause of these neurochemical perturbations in HD, the MeSHD011506 levels and enzymatic activity of MeSHD014365 (TPH), the rate-limiting MeSHD004798 in MeSHD012701 MeSHQ000096, were determined. MeSHQ000201 was measured in MeSHD001933 homogenates from 4-, 8-, and 12-week-old R6/2 MeSHD051379 and compared with MeSHD000368-matched wild-type MeSHQ000517 MeSHD051379. We observed a 62% decrease in MeSHD001933 TPH activity (p = 0.009) in 4-week-old R6/2 MeSHD051379, well before the onset of MeSHD001526. In addition, significant decreases in TPH activity were also observed at 8 and 12 weeks of age (61%, p = 0.02 and 86%, p = 0.005, respectively). In the 12-week-old-MeSHD051379, no change in immunoreactive TPH was observed. MeSHD066298 binding showed that TPH does not bind to MeSHD005091 1 of huntingtin in a MeSHC097188-dependent manner. Specifically, MeSHD005982 huntingtin MeSHD005091 1 MeSHD011506 with 20, 32 or 53 MeSHC097188 did not interact with radiolabeled MeSHD014365. Therefore, the inhibition of TPH activity does not appear to result from a direct huntingtin/TPH interaction. Receptor binding analyses for the MeSHD044282 in 12-week-old R6/2 MeSHD051379 revealed significant reductions in 8-MeSHC031356[3H]DPAT binding in several hippocampal and cortical regions. These results demonstrate that the serotonergic system in the R6/2 MeSHD051379 is severely disrupted in both presymptomatic and symptomatic MeSHD051379. The presymptomatic inhibition of TPH activity in the R6/2 MeSHD051379 may help explain the functional consequences of HD and provide insights into new targets for MeSHD004358.
78	7651139	Overexpression of wild-type and mutant NDP MeSHD010770 in MeSHD004023.	MeSHD009705 MeSHD011756 (NDP) MeSHD010770 has a central MeSHD012380 in the synthesis of (deoxy-)trinucleotides. In addition, MeSHD009154 in the MeSHD005796 encoding NDP MeSHD010770 have been shown to have important consequences for MeSHD004330 MeSHQ000254 and mammalian tumorogenesis. We have overexpressed, in MeSHD004023, a genomic MeSHD002999 encoding the MeSHD004798 NDP MeSHD010770. The concomitant increase in the levels of MeSHD012313 and MeSHQ000201 identifies a 5' non-MeSHD059019 genomic region of 0.9 kb as being the complete MeSHD011401. Overexpression of wild-type NDP MeSHD010770 has no effect on MeSHQ000254. This is also true for an inactive mutant H122C that does not have a dominant inhibitor effect. Overexpression of the P105G mutant NDP MeSHD010770, which is known to be affected in its stability MeSHD066298, only MeSHD007854 to a small increase in total NDP-MeSHD010770 activity. Thermal and chemical denaturation experiments demonstrate the formation of hexameric MeSHD002678 between wild-type and mutant monomers.
79	9166661	Impact of natural IRS-1 MeSHD009154 on MeSHD007328 signals: MeSHD009154 of IRS-1 in the PTB domain and near SH2 MeSHD011485 sites result in impaired MeSHQ000502 at different steps of IRS-1 signaling.	MeSHD055504 (IRS-1) is one of the major substrates of MeSHC410467 and mediates various MeSHD007328 signals downstream. In this study, we have examined the impact of three natural IRS-1 MeSHD009154 identified in MeSHD003924 MeSHD010361 (G971R, P170R, and M209T) on MeSHD007328 signaling. G971R is located near src homology 2 MeSHD011485 sites, and P170R and M209T are located in the MeSHD019000 binding domain of IRS-1. 32D-IR MeSHD002477, stably overexpressing MeSHD006801 MeSHD011972, were transfected with wild-type MeSHD006801 IRS-1 MeSHD018076 (WT) or three mutant IRS-1 MeSHD018076 and analyzed. All the MeSHD002460 expressing mutant IRS-1 showed a significant reduction in [3H]MeSHD013936 incorporation compared with WT. Upon MeSHD007328 stimulation, MeSHD002477 expressing G971R showed a 39% decrease (P < 0.005) in MeSHD058539 (MeSHD019869) activity, a 43% decrease (P < 0.01) in binding of the 85-kDa regulatory subunit of MeSHD019869, and a 22% decrease (P < 0.05) in MeSHD020928 activity compared with those expressing WT. MeSHD002477 expressing P170R and M209T showed slight but significant decreases in MeSHD019869 activity (17 and 14%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in binding of p85 (22 and 16%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and a greater decrease in MeSHD020928 activity (41 and 43%, respectively; both P < 0.005) compared with WT. After MeSHD007328 stimulation, MeSHD002477 expressing P170R and M209T showed significant decreases in IRS-1 MeSHD010766 (37 and 42%, respectively; both P < 0.05) and in IRS-1 binding to the MeSHD011972 (48 and 53%, respectively; P < 0.01) compared with WT. G971R showed no changes in IRS-1 MeSHD010766 and in IRS-1 binding to the MeSHD011972 compared with WT. These data suggest that the impaired mitogenic response of P170R and M209T was mainly due to reduced binding to the MeSHD011972, whereas the impaired response of G971R was mainly due to reduced MeSHD001244 with MeSHD019869 p85.
80	7820367	Interaction between alcohol and MeSHD053583 on MeSHD000324 MeSHQ000378 and the expression of MeSHD017781 in the MeSHD007031.	We have observed that alcohol does not alter MeSHD000324 (MeSHD000324) released in response to the iv MeSHD007267 of MeSHD053583 (MeSHD053583). In contrast, prior (-30 to -90 min) MeSHD009934 of moderate doses of alcohol (0.5-2.0 g/kg) significantly blunts MeSHD000324 MeSHQ000378 following the intracerebroventricular (icv) MeSHD007267 of the MeSHD016207. We explored two possible mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon: MeSHD000305 MeSHD005246 and alcohol-induced inhibition of hypothalamic neuronal activation (measured through changes in c-fos and NGFI-B MeSHD012333 levels). Increasing MeSHD010949 MeSHD003345 levels by exposing MeSHD051381 to mild MeSHD004597 or injecting them with MeSHD003345 did not alter MeSHD000324 released by MeSHD051381 administered with MeSHD053583 into the MeSHD001921 ventricles. Alcohol, which by itself did not stimulate c-fos or NGFI-B MeSHD012333 levels in the MeSHD010286 of the MeSHD007031, significantly blunted the MeSHD001076 of icv MeSHD053583 to increase the expression of these MeSHD017781. We conclude that the inhibitory influence exerted by prior alcohol MeSHQ000628 on MeSHD000324 released by icv administered MeSHD053583 may reflect an interference with the stimulatory influence of the MeSHD016207 on hypothalamic MeSHD009474 involved in the activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.
81	10975615	MeSHD009315 MeSHD006040 for MeSHD001525.	Because all MeSHD006262 conditions for which the MeSHD009315 (MeSHD009315) is responsible manifest at the level of MeSHD001519, and all interventions must have an impact at the behavioral level, MeSHD009315 is firmly committed to the support of MeSHD001525. In an era in which MeSHD012106 in areas that some view as reductionist--for example, MeSHD023281, MeSHQ000235, MeSHD023281 and MeSHD040901, and molecular MeSHD012586--is especially promising, MeSHD009315 is striving to maintain a balance in its portfolio with studies that explore integrative aspects of MeSHD001695, including MeSHD001519. Without this perspective, new information about fundamental processes MeSHD014836 prove ultimately to be shallow. This MeSHD016420 discusses how MeSHD032882 of MeSHD001921 and MeSHD001519 in MeSHD001523 and MeSHD006262 calls for integrating bottom-up MeSHD012106 that studies MeSHD001921 and MeSHD001519 through MeSHD005796 and molecules, with top-down MeSHD012106 that examines the impact of MeSHD004777.
82	8263519	Preservation of MeSHD010084, MeSHD011073, and MeSHD005998 modulatory domains of the MeSHD016194 in MeSHD000544.	This study used [3H]MeSHD016291 ([3H]MeSHD016291) binding to the MeSHD016202 (MeSHD016202) receptor to examine MeSHD010084, MeSHD011073, and MeSHD005998 modulatory sites in MeSHD008566 derived from the superior frontal and the superior MeSHD013702 of MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544. In MeSHQ000517 subjects the competitive MeSHD011073 site antagonist MeSHC006624 inhibited [3H]MeSHD016291 binding in a dose-dependent fashion and this curve was shifted to the right by the addition of 50 microM MeSHD013095. MeSHC006624 inhibition of binding was more potent in the MeSHD013702 than in the MeSHD005625, in both the absence and presence of 50 microM MeSHD013095. In MeSHD000544, MeSHC006624 inhibition of [3H]MeSHD016291 binding (in both the absence and the presence of MeSHD013095) was not different from MeSHQ000517 in either of the two MeSHD001921 areas examined. The sulfhydryl MeSHD010084 site of the MeSHD016194 was assessed using the MeSHD016877 5,5'-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic MeSHD000143), which inhibited binding in a dose-dependent fashion. This inhibition was similar in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 and MeSHQ000517 subjects. MeSHD005998-stimulated [3H]MeSHD016291 binding was also unaffected in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544. However, in the MeSHD013702 there was a significant age-associated decline in [3H]MeSHD016291 binding in the presence of 100 microM MeSHD018698 (Rs = -0.71) and 100 microM MeSHD018698 plus 30 microM MeSHD005998 (Rs = -0.90). There was also an age-related increase in MeSHC006624 MeSHD020128 (which reflects an age-related decrease in MeSHC006624 affinity) in the MeSHD005625, determined both in the absence (Rs = 0.83) and the presence (Rs = 0.79) of MeSHD013095. These data indicate that the MeSHD016194 and its modulatory MeSHD010084, MeSHD011073, and MeSHD005998 subsites are intact in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000544 and that the modulatory activity of MeSHD011073 and MeSHD005998 sites decline with MeSHD000375.
83	8299936	A MAP MeSHD010770 homolog, mpk-1, is involved in ras-mediated induction of vulval MeSHD002477 fates in MeSHD017173.	During MeSHQ000254 of the MeSHD017173 hermaphrodite, the gonadal anchor MeSHD002477 induces nearby Pn.p MeSHD002477 to adopt vulval fates. The response to this signal is mediated by a receptor MeSHD011505 MeSHD015398 that has been remarkably well conserved during metazoan evolution. Because MeSHD008934-activated MeSHD011506 (MAP) MeSHD010770 are activated by receptor MeSHD011505 pathways in MeSHD014714 MeSHD002477, we hypothesized that C. elegans MAP MeSHD010770 homologs may MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in vulval induction. Two C. elegans MAP MeSHD010770 MeSHD005796, mpk-1 and mpk-2 (mpk, MAP MeSHD010770), were cloned using degenerate MeSHD017931 and MeSHD016133 amplification; in parallel, MeSHD005796 involved in vulval induction were identified by MeSHQ000175 for MeSHD009154 that suppress the vulval MeSHQ000002 caused by an activated let-60 MeSHD011905. One such MeSHD013489 is an MeSHD000483 of mpk-1. We used a new type of mosaic MeSHQ000032 to show that mpk-1 acts MeSHD002477 autonomously in the Pn.p MeSHD002477. Our results show that mpk-1 MeSHD010988 an important functional MeSHD012380 as an activator in ras-mediated MeSHD015398 in vivo.
84	8139849	[Familial MeSHD010051 MeSHD013577].	This MeSHD010209 gives an overview of the familial MeSHD010051. MeSHD010051 prone MeSHD005190 defined as two or more first or second degree MeSHD005190 with MeSHD010051, are of clinical importance because first or second degree MeSHD005190 of affected MeSHD014930 are at MeSHD012306 of developing MeSHD010051. These MeSHD014930 need MeSHQ000453 including prophylactic MeSHD010052 in those with increased MeSHD012306. MeSHD014930 with hereditary MeSHD010051 are at the greatest MeSHD012306. Familial MeSHD010051 studies are also important in terms of MeSHD012106. They provide the best MeSHD065026 of identifying a MeSHD005796 involved in the genesis of MeSHD010051. There is good evidence that such a MeSHD005796 is likely to be involved in the MeSHQ000254 of non-familial MeSHD010051 as well. This might be a clue to MeSHD032882 the MeSHD001695 of MeSHD010051. Therefore MeSHD010051 prone MeSHD005190 should be identified and, since familial MeSHD010051 is rare, available details about affected and non-affected MeSHD005190 should be registered at least at national level. The author set up the Hungarian MeSHD012042 for familial ovarian MeSHD002277 at the National Institute of Oncology Budapest.
85	12044926	MeSHD020411 for assessing MeSHD010051 MeSHD015870.	Although MeSHD020411 MeSHQ000032 is presented as a revolution in MeSHD015870 studies, it is in fact based on the classic technique of Southern MeSHD004247 hybridisation where a labelled MeSHD015342 is hybridised to MeSHD004277 that is bound to a solid support matrix. The truly revolutionary aspect of MeSHD046228 lies in the fact that, within a given MeSHD002477 MeSHD011153, the expression of tens of thousands of MeSHD005796, and ultimately the entire MeSHD016678, can be assayed simultaneously. This capability, when coupled with powerful MeSHD000078332 MeSHD012984, allows MeSHD012108 to rapidly compare MeSHD015870 between two MeSHD002477 MeSHD011153. In the MeSHD009369 field, this enables MeSHD012108 to compare MeSHD015870 between normal and malignant MeSHD002477 and to identify MeSHD005796 that are differentially regulated during MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254. Microarray data can also be used to categorize tumours on the basis of their molecular profile, which may provide important MeSHD001688, diagnostic and prognostic information. As little as 5 years ago identifying even a few differentially expressed MeSHD005796 may have taken several years and MeSHD003365 tens of thousands of dollars. Today microarrays can identify ten MeSHD013995 the number of candidate MeSHD005796 in just a few months and at a tenth of the MeSHD003365. Even so, MeSHD046228 is still in its infancy and the MeSHD013672 is advancing rapidly. There is little doubt that microarrays MeSHD014836 revolutionize our MeSHD001076 to quantify the complex changes that occur in MeSHD015870 during MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254. The greatest challenge that lies ahead is how to translate this MeSHD019359 into clinically useful diagnostic and MeSHD013812 tools. In this MeSHD016454, we describe the technical aspects of MeSHD020411 MeSHQ000032 and some of the current and MeSHD005544 applications of this MeSHD013672 for analysing MeSHD015870 in MeSHD010051.
86	9224643	MeSHD001053 E MeSHD020478 stable complexes with recombinant MeSHD000544 MeSHD016229 precursor MeSHD011506.	MeSHD001053 E (MeSHD001057), a MeSHD011506 genetically linked to the MeSHD015994 of MeSHD000544, MeSHD020478 SDS-stable complexes MeSHD066298 with MeSHD016229 MeSHD010455 (Abeta), the primary component of MeSHD058225. In the present study, we investigated whether MeSHD001057 was able to bind full-length Abeta precursor MeSHD011506 (APP). Using a MeSHD058619-APP fusion MeSHD011506 and MeSHD006801 MeSHD008079 (VLDL), we detected an interaction of MeSHD001057 with APP that was inhibited by Abeta or anti-MeSHD001057 antibody. Saturation-binding experiments indicated a single binding equilibrium with an apparent 1:1 stoichiometry and a MeSHD004213 constant of 15 nM. An interaction was also observed using MeSHD001057 from MeSHD002555 or delipidated VLDL, as well as recombinant MeSHD001057. APP.MeSHD001057 complexes were SDS-stable, and their formation was not inhibited by reducing conditions; however, they were dissociated by SDS under reducing conditions. MeSHD001057.APP complexes formed high-molecular-mass aggregates, and competition experiments suggested that MeSHD000596 14-23 of Abeta are responsible for complex-formation. Finally, no differences were found when studying the interaction of APP with MeSHD053318 or MeSHD053327. Taken together, our results demonstrate that MeSHD001057 may MeSHD020478 stable complexes with the Abeta moiety of APP with characteristics similar to those of complexes formed with isolated Abeta, and suggest the intriguing possibility that MeSHD001057-APP interactions may be pathologically relevant in vivo.
87	11040166	Importance of intestinal colonisation in the maturation of MeSHD056724 in early infancy: a prospective MeSHD005500 of healthy MeSHD007223 MeSHD000368 0-6 months.	To evaluate the MeSHD012380 of MeSHD000069196 and early formula feeding in the maturation of MeSHD056724 in healthy MeSHD007231. Sixty four healthy MeSHD007223 were studied. Faecal colonisation with MeSHD001441 group, MeSHD001644-like, and MeSHD007778-like MeSHQ000382 was examined at 1, 2, and 6 months of age, and also the number of MeSHD007070-secreting, MeSHD007075-secreting, and MeSHD007074-secreting MeSHD002477 (detected by MeSHD058501) at 0, 2, and 6 months of age. Intestinal colonisation with MeSHQ000382 from the B fragilis group was more closely associated with maturation of MeSHD007070-secreting and MeSHD007075-secreting MeSHD002477 than colonisation with the other bacterial genera studied or MeSHD004032. MeSHD007223 colonised with B fragilis at 1 month of age had more MeSHD007070-secreting and MeSHD007075-secreting MeSHD002477/10(6) mononuclear MeSHD002477 at 2 months of age (geometric mean (95% MeSHD016001) 1393 (962 to 2018) and 754 (427 to 1332) respectively) than MeSHD007223 not colonised (1015 (826 to 1247) and 394 (304 to 511) respectively); p = 0.04 and p = 0.009 respectively. The type of MeSHQ000382 colonising the MeSHD007422 of MeSHD007231 and the timing may determine the MeSHD056747 of the naive MeSHD007107.
88	10853862	Activation of MeSHC093349 in a MeSHD003550 respiratory MeSHD004847 line by MeSHC075773, MeSHD019833 and CPX.	The cellular basis of MeSHD003550 (CF) is a defect in a cyclic MeSHD000249 (cAMP)-activated MeSHD018118 (CF transmembrane conductance regulator) in MeSHD004847 that MeSHD007854 to decreased MeSHD002712 MeSHD017136 and impaired MeSHD014867 transport across the MeSHD002462. This study investigated whether it was possible to activate the defective MeSHD018118 in MeSHD003550 respiratory MeSHD004847 with MeSHC075773 (MeSHC121358), MeSHD019833 and MeSHC051360 (CPX). The CF bronchial MeSHD004847 line CFBE41o-, which expresses the deltaF508 MeSHD009154, was treated with these agents and loss of Cl-, indicating Cl- efflux, measured by MeSHD004577. MeSHD015124 alone did not induce Cl- efflux in CFBE41o- MeSHD002477, but after incubation with MeSHC121358 a significant efflux of Cl- occurred. Stimulation of MeSHD002477 with a combination of MeSHD019833 and cAMP also induced Cl- efflux, whereas a combination of pretreatment with MeSHC121358 and a combined stimulation with MeSHD019833 and cAMP induced an even larger Cl- efflux. Cl- efflux could also be stimulated by CPX, but this effect was not enhanced by MeSHC121358 pretreatment. The deltaF508 MeSHD009154 MeSHD007854 to impaired processing of the MeSHD019005. The increased efflux of MeSHD002712 after MeSHC075773 MeSHQ000628 can be explained by the fact that MeSHC075773 allows the deltaF508 MeSHD019005 to escape MeSHQ000378 and to be transported to the MeSHD002477 surface. MeSHD019833 and MeSHC051360 act by stimulating MeSHD002712 ion efflux by increasing the MeSHD011336 of the MeSHD019005 being open. The combination of MeSHC075773 and MeSHD019833 may be useful in a potential pharmacological MeSHQ000628 for MeSHD003550 MeSHD010361 with the deltaF508 MeSHD009154.
89	7981461	MeSHD020847 MeSHD012926 of MeSHD002453 progression and MeSHD019940 expression in MCF-7 MeSHD006801 MeSHD001943 MeSHD002477.	The molecular mechanisms by which MeSHD020847 inhibit MeSHD001943 MeSHD049109 are not well understood. Using cultured MeSHD001943 MeSHD002460, we studied the effects of MeSHD020847 on proliferation and MeSHD002453 progression and used this information to select candidate MeSHD002453 MeSHD005809 that are potential targets for MeSHD020847. Under MeSHD004967- and MeSHD044967-free conditions MeSHD020847 inhibited proliferation of MeSHD061986 stimulated with MeSHD007328. MeSHD002477 were blocked at a point in MeSHD016193. These effects are comparable with those in MeSHD044967- and MeSHD004967-containing medium and were also seen to a lesser degree in MeSHD008819 bearing MCF-7 MeSHD009369. Similar MeSHD019370 with other MeSHD010455 MeSHD008934 suggest that the process inhibited by MeSHD020847 is common to MeSHD004967 and MeSHD036341 activated pathways. Other studies have identified G1 MeSHD016213 as potential targets for MeSHD036341 and MeSHD013256 MeSHD006728/MeSHD013256 antagonist MeSHD012926 of MeSHD001940 MeSHD004847 proliferation. In MeSHD061986 growing in the presence of MeSHD012710, MeSHD019938 MeSHD012333 was rapidly down-regulated by steroidal and nonsteroidal MeSHD020847 by an apparently MeSHD011960 mediated mechanism. MeSHD019940 expression was maximally inhibited before effects on entry into MeSHD016196 and inhibition was therefore not merely a consequence of changes in MeSHD002453 progression. Together with data on the effects of MeSHD020847 in MeSHD044967-free conditions [1], these results suggest MeSHD015536 of MeSHD019938 by MeSHD020847 may be a general phenomenon in MeSHD011960-positive MeSHD001943 MeSHD002477, independent of MeSHQ000208 conditions and class of MeSHD020847. These MeSHD019370 are compatible with the hypothesis that reductions in MeSHD019938 levels may mediate in part the action of MeSHD020847 in blocking entry of MeSHD002477 into MeSHD016196.
90	8797472	Polymorphism at MeSHD003062 129 or MeSHD003062 219 of PRNP and clinical heterogeneity in a previously unreported MeSHD005190 with Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker MeSHD004194 (PrP-P102L MeSHD009154).	We present a new, large, Italian MeSHD005190 affected by Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker MeSHD013577 (GSS) associated with the Pro to Leu MeSHD017354 at MeSHD003062 102 of the MeSHD000072002 MeSHD005796 (PRNP). The affected members of this MeSHD005190 show a remarkable MeSHD000073537 of the MeSHD004194: three of them had a clinical picture characterized by MeSHD003704 and a brief illness duration (less than 1 year), while the other five members presented an ataxic, slowly evolving MeSHD013577 (a clinical duration of 3 to 4 years) with no evidence of MeSHD060825. Despite these remarkable clinical differences among affected members, we found no correlation between the clinical presentation and the MeSHD003062 129 or MeSHD003062 219 MeSHD005838. These data suggest that factors as yet unidentified may influence the clinical expression of the MeSHD004194.
91	11741523	MeSHD051246 in MeSHD006801 MeSHD050527 modulated by MeSHD016212 and MeSHC020491.	To identify GLUT1 in MeSHD006801 MeSHD050527 and its MeSHD012926 by MeSHD053773 and MeSHC020491. Identification of GLUT1 was performed in MeSHD006801 MeSHD050527 by analyzing its MeSHD012333 expression, MeSHD011506 product, and functional MeSHQ000032. The effects of MeSHD053773 and MeSHC020491 on MeSHD005947 uptake and GLUT1 MeSHD012333 expression in MeSHD050527 were examined by [3H]-MeSHD003847 uptake and MeSHD015152 MeSHQ000032. It was found that MeSHD006801 MeSHD050527 do express functional GLUT1. The 2-DOG uptake of MeSHD050527 was markedly increased by MeSHD053773 stimulation with simultaneous elevated expression of GLUT1 MeSHD012333. Increased MeSHD005947 uptake and GLUT1 MeSHD012333 expression in MeSHD050527 induced by MeSHD053773 were markedly attenuated by MeSHC020491 in a dose-dependent manner. We found that functional GLUT1 did present in MeSHD006801 MeSHD050527. MeSHD053773 stimulated the MeSHD005947 uptake in MeSHD050527 through MeSHD015854 of GLUT1 expression, this effect of MeSHD053773 could be antagonized by MeSHC020491.

Most studies have reported an MeSHD015854 of MeSHD018168 (RAR) MeSHD012333 expression by MeSHD014212 (RA). We aimed to study the effect of RA on RAR MeSHD011506 levels in MCF-7 MeSHD006801 MeSHD001943 MeSHD002477. Incubation of these MeSHD002477 with 10(-6) M RA induced a rapid breakdown of both RARalpha and MeSHC082926 in spite of the accumulation of their MeSHD012333. MeSHD046988 specific MeSHQ000037 blocked the RA-induced breakdown of RARs. Furthermore, RA enhanced the formation of the complex between RARalpha and MeSHD025801 in a concentration- and MeSHD013995-dependent manner, suggesting the involvement of MeSHD025801 and MeSHD046988 in this reaction. MeSHD047490 (RXRalpha) was also decreased, albeit to a lesser extent, in RA-treated MeSHD002477. MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD062165 MeSHQ000819 and MeSHQ000037 clearly showed that the effect of the MeSHD012176 on the breakdown of the MeSHD012176 receptors is receptor-MeSHD008024 agonist-dependent and blunted by the antagonist. An MeSHD024202, using nuclear extracts from RA-treated MeSHD002477, showed that a reduction in complex formation with MeSHD006728 MeSHD020218 correlated with the reduction of RAR and MeSHD047488. These data suggest that RA induces the breakdown of RARs through a process involving MeSHD054875 and that this phenomenon MeSHQ000209 a reduction in the formation of MeSHC033365 complexes.
93	12693446	MeSHD012380 of modified Widal test in the MeSHD003933 of MeSHD014435.	To evaluate the diagnostic MeSHD012680 of modified Widal for recent MeSHD007239 in comparison with conventional Widal test. Modified widal test was simultaneously done along with conventional Widal test in MeSHD044967 samples obtained from 50 bacteriologically positive cases of MeSHD014435 as well as 50 healthy individuals. A four-fold difference in the titres was noticed in the 50 sera of the test group and no MeSHD005249 in the titres of the MeSHD035061. The early rising O MeSHD000906 which are predominantly MeSHD007075 in MeSHD019368. These are due to recent MeSHD007239 and are inactivated by MeSHD008623. On the other MeSHD006225 H is a mixture of MeSHD007074 and MeSHD007075 hence MeSHD007075 portion gets inactivated giving rise to fall in titre. By inactivating MeSHD007075 in modified Widal test, the MeSHD000371 would be brought about only by specific MeSHD007074 while in the conventional Widal test MeSHD000371 is due to specific MeSHD007074 and MeSHD007075. The difference in the titres indicates specific MeSHD007075 class of MeSHD000906 which is the hallmark of recent MeSHD007239. If conventional Widal test and modified Widal test are simultaneously done, one can be definite about the MeSHD003933 of MeSHD014435.
94	12417439	MeSHD007109 MeSHD015870 increases in the MeSHD000375 MeSHD051189 MeSHD006624.	Using MeSHD020411, basal and MeSHD008070 (LPS)-induced MeSHD015870 was examined in the MeSHD006624 of 3-, 12-, 18- and 24-month-old MeSHD008297 C57BL/6 MeSHD051379 to identify MeSHD005796 whose altered expression could influence hippocampal MeSHQ000502 in advanced age. MeSHD005796 MeSHD004602 that changed with age were selected with a t-MeSHD020500 and specific expression patterns were confirmed with real-MeSHD013995 quantitative MeSHD016133. Basal expression of 128 MeSHD005796 MeSHD004602 clearly changed with age in the MeSHD006624. Fourteen MeSHD005796 MeSHD004602 showed increased expression with age and these increases were validated after LPS stimulation. MeSHD008285 (MHC) TL region and thymic shared MeSHD000941 (MeSHC084839) MeSHD015870 increased, suggesting MeSHD013601 activation in the MeSHD006624 with age. MeSHD016207 (MeSHD007378 (IL)-1beta, MeSHD014409 (TNF)-alpha) and MeSHD018925 (MeSHD008264 chemotactic MeSHD011506-1) expression increased sharply in 24-month-old MeSHD051379. These MeSHQ000175 are in contrast to a decrease in the peripheral MeSHD007109, documented by decreased MeSHD013601 proliferation and decreased ratios of naive to MeSHD000091246. Age-related increases in inflammatory potential in the MeSHD001921 may contribute to MeSHD019636 of the MeSHD000368.
95	11403571	The MeSHD000078791 (TAP) MeSHD008722: a general MeSHD008722 of MeSHD011506 complex MeSHQ000302.	Identification of components present in MeSHD001688 complexes requires their MeSHQ000302 to near homogeneity. MeSHQ000379 of MeSHQ000302 vary from MeSHD011506 to MeSHD011506, making it impossible to design a general MeSHQ000302 strategy valid for all cases. We have developed the MeSHD000078791 (TAP) MeSHD008722 as a tool that allows rapid MeSHQ000302 under native conditions of complexes, even when expressed at their natural level. Prior MeSHD019359 of complex composition or MeSHQ000502 is not required. The TAP MeSHD008722 requires fusion of the TAP tag, either N- or C-terminally, to the target MeSHD011506 of interest. Starting from a relatively small number of MeSHD002477, active MeSHD046911 can be isolated and used for multiple applications. Variations of the MeSHD008722 to specifically purify complexes containing two given components or to subtract undesired complexes can easily be implemented. The TAP MeSHD008722 was initially developed in MeSHD015003 but can be successfully adapted to various organisms. Its simplicity, high yield, and wide applicability make the TAP MeSHD008722 a very useful MeSHD008722 for MeSHD011506 MeSHQ000302 and MeSHD020543 exploration.
96	11990295	Functional properties of EGFP-tagged MeSHD018482 MeSHD002118-release channel (MeSHD019837) expressed in MeSHD019556: MeSHD012680 to MeSHD002110 and 4-chloro-MeSHC042041.	We constructed and expressed in MeSHD019556, three E-MeSHD049452 (EGFP) tagged recombinant MeSHD018482 MeSHD019837 (RYR). EGFP was tagged to (i) the NH2-terminus (nEGFP-RYR(FL)) and to (ii) the COOH-terminus (cRYR(FL)-EGFP) of the full length RYR; we also tagged the EGFP to (iii) the NH2-terminus of a truncated version of the RYR (nEGFP-RYR(Bhat)) lacking the bulk of the MeSHD011506. The fluorescent pattern EGFP with all three constructs colocalize with that of an MeSHD004721 (ER) MeSHD008566 tracker MeSHD005456, indicating that the RYR constructs are targeted to ER MeSHD008566. Our results show that: (i) COOH-terminal tagging abolishes the MeSHD012680 of the RYR to MeSHD002110, whereas the presence of EGFP at the NH2-terminus does not MeSHD000339 MeSHD002110 MeSHD012680 and (ii) 4-Cl-MeSHC042041 MeSHD012680 is lost both with the truncated nEGFP-RYR(Bhat) and the nEGFP-RYR(FL), while COOH-terminal tagging does not MeSHD000339 MeSHD012680 to 4-chloro-MeSHC042041. The dose-response curves of MeSHD002110-induced MeSHD002118 release of nEGFP-RYR(FL) differ from those of the truncated nEGFP-RYR(Bhat). Maximal MeSHD002118 release was approached at 10 mM MeSHD002110 with the nEGFP-RYR(FL), while MeSHD002477 expressing the nEGFP-RYR(Bhat) construct displayed a bell shaped curve and the maximal concentration for MeSHD002110-induced MeSHD002118 release was 5 mM. Equilibrium [3H]-MeSHD012433 binding confirmed the MeSHD002118 MeSHD010783 data. Our results demonstrate that EGFP tagging modifies the pharmacological properties of RYR, and suggest that 4-chloro-MeSHC042041 and MeSHD002110 act through different mechanisms and probably interact with different sites on the RYR MeSHD002118 release channel.
97	10662772	Mass transport of proform of a KDEL-tailed MeSHD057056 (SH-EP) to MeSHD011506 storage MeSHD014617 by MeSHD004721-derived vesicle is involved in MeSHD011506 mobilization in germinating MeSHD012639.	A vacuolar MeSHD057056, designated SH-EP, is expressed in the MeSHD018548 of germinated MeSHD000070658 MeSHD012639 and is responsible for the MeSHQ000378 of storage MeSHD011506. SH-EP is a characteristic vacuolar MeSHD010447 possessing a COOH-terminal MeSHD004721 (ER) retention sequence, KDEL. In this MeSHD014937, immunocytochemical MeSHQ000032 of the MeSHD018548 MeSHD002477 of germinated V. mungo MeSHD012639 was performed using seven kinds of MeSHD000906 to identify the intracellular transport pathway of SH-EP from ER to MeSHD011506 storage MeSHD014617. A proform of SH-EP synthesized in ER accumulated at the edge or middle region of ER where the MeSHD022161 was formed. The vesicle containing a large amount of proSH-EP, termed KV, budded off from ER, bypassed the MeSHD006056, and was sorted to MeSHD011506 storage MeSHD014617. This massive transport of SH-EP via KV was MeSHD013850 to mediate dynamic MeSHD011506 mobilization in the MeSHD018548 MeSHD002477 of germinated MeSHD012639. We discuss the possibilities that the MeSHC073762 of KDEL-tailed vacuolar MeSHD057056 MeSHQ000502 as an accumulation signal at ER, and that the mass transport of the MeSHD010447 by ER-derived KV-like vesicle is involved in the MeSHD011506 mobilization of MeSHD010944.
98	9415705	Characterization of a MeSHD006801 MeSHD005982 mu cluster containing a duplicated GSTM1 MeSHD005796 that MeSHQ000209 ultrarapid MeSHQ000201.	The mu class MeSHD005982 MeSHD005796 GSTM1 is polymorphic in MeSHD006801, with approximately half of the Caucasian MeSHD011153 being homozygous deleted for this MeSHD005796. GSTM1 MeSHD004798 MeSHQ000172 has been suggested to predispose people to MeSHD008168 and MeSHD001749. Some people in a Saudi Arabian MeSHD011153, however, have been described previously with ultrarapid GSTM1 MeSHQ000201. Here we have evaluated the MeSHD008967 basis for this MeSHD019370. Genomic MeSHD004247 from two Saudi Arabian subjects exhibiting ultrarapid MeSHQ000201 and from 13 Swedish subjects having null, one, or two GSTM1 MeSHD005796 were subjected to MeSHD012150 MeSHQ000032 using the restriction MeSHD004798 MeSHD015246, EcoRV, and HindIII and combinations thereof. Hybridization was carried out using a full-length GSTM1 MeSHD018076 or the 5' and 3' parts of the MeSHD018076. The MeSHD015183 data revealed the presence of a GST mu cluster with two GSTM1 MeSHD005796 in tandem situated between the GSTM2 and GSTM5 MeSHD005796. A quantitative MeSHD060885 MeSHD008722, which simultaneously amplified a fragment of the GSTM1 MeSHD005796 and the MeSHD055544 MeSHD005796, was developed, and the genomic GSTM1 copy number was determined from the GSTM1/MeSHD055544 ratio. This MeSHD008722 clearly MeSHD004243 GSTM1 +/- subjects (ratios between 0.4 and 0.7) from GSTM1 +/+ subjects (ratios between 0.8 and 1.2). The two Saudi Arabians with ultrarapid GSTM1 activities had ratios of approximately 1.5, indicating that they carried three GSTM1 MeSHD005796. These results demonstrate the existence of a novel mu class GST cluster containing a duplicated active GSTM1 MeSHD005796 causing ultrarapid MeSHQ000201.
99	10981425	[Effects of age on the MeSHQ000209 of MeSHQ000150 and the extent of lesions in MeSHD014376 of thoracic MeSHD008198 in MeSHD002648].	Fifty one MeSHD002648 with MeSHD014376 of intrathoracic MeSHD008198 were examined to define an MeSHD001244 of the severity and extent of damage with age. This type of MeSHD014376 that occurs in babies runs with MeSHQ000150. It is more frequently detected in MeSHD002648 under 3 years on their MeSHD012017 to MeSHD000072143. In MeSHD012574-age MeSHD002648, this MeSHD014376 is accompanied by the involvement of a group of intrathoracic MeSHD008198 and diagnosed more frequently in the phase of early calcification.
100	10366440	The Schrödinger's MeSHD002415 quandary in MeSHD003585: integration of live MeSHD002477 functional assays with measurements of fixed MeSHD002477 in MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD017209.	"The existing cytometric MeSHQ000379 do not allow one to directly correlate, within the same MeSHD002477, functional MeSHD002477 attributes that are revealed supravitally with features that require MeSHD002477 fixation to be detected or measured. Taking advantage of the ""file merge"" feature of the MeSHD007834-scanning cytometer, we have been able to correlate the supravital changes that occur during MeSHD017209, namely the drop in MeSHD053078 (Delta Psim) and generation of the reactive MeSHD010100 intermediates (ROIs), with features revealed by MeSHQ000032 of fixed MeSHD002477: the MeSHD002453 position and MeSHD053938. The MeSHD002453 position was established based on the MeSHD002477's stainability with MeSHD011419 while MeSHD053938 was assessed by in situ MeSHD004247 strand break labeling using exogenous MeSHD004253. During MeSHD017209 of MeSHD018922 induced by the MeSHD059004 MeSHD002166 (MeSHC000708228), the dissipation of Delta Psim occurred preferentially in MeSHD016196 MeSHD002477 and preceded the appearance of MeSHD004247 strand breaks. Essentially all MeSHD002477 with MeSHD004247 strand breaks had dissipated Delta Psim. Compared to the decrease of Delta Psim, the MeSHC000708228-induced rise in ROIs during MeSHD017209 was less restricted to MeSHD016196 MeSHD002477. Furthermore, no elevation of ROIs was detected in a significant proportion of MeSHD002477 with MeSHD004247 strand breaks. The data suggest that MeSHD053938 may occur in some MeSHD002477 prior to the increase in ROIs and thus, unlike the dissipation of Delta Psim, the MeSHD018384 may not be a prerequisite for activation of an MeSHD004720. Alternatively, the MeSHD018384 may be a MeSHD014171 event, occupying a narrow ""MeSHD013995 window"" during the apoptotic process. The approach opens a possibility to study direct relationships, within the same MeSHD002477, between cellular changes (e.g., occurring during MeSHD017209, mitogenesis, differentiation, etc.) detected by functional assays of live MeSHD002477 and changes that cannot be analyzed supravitally."
101	10603087	NKX2 MeSHD015870 in MeSHD054258 but not in mesendodermally derived structures depends on sonic MeSHD006364 in MeSHD051379 MeSHD004628.	NKX2 MeSHD005796 in MeSHD014714 encode a sub- MeSHD005190 of homeodomain-containing MeSHD014157 which regulate morphogenetic events and MeSHD002454 during MeSHD047108. In MeSHD051379 MeSHD004628 several NKX2 MeSHD005796 are expressed in the ventral midline domains of the MeSHD054258, while other NKX2 MeSHD005796 are primarily expressed in the mesendoderm and mesendodermally derived organs, such as MeSHD006321 and gut. Within several patterning centers for MeSHD014024 MeSHD009938 sonic MeSHD006364 (Shh) is an important signal in the formation of ventral midline structures in MeSHD014714 MeSHD004628. Here, we investigated the MeSHD012380 of Shh in the embryonic expression of six different but closely related NKX2 MeSHD005796 in Shh null mutant MeSHD051379. We found that expression of NKX2.1, NKX2.2, and NKX2.9 in neural domains requires Shh signaling, whereas NKX2.3, NKX2.5 and NKX2.6 expression in MeSHD004707 and MeSHD008648 is independent of Shh.
102	8809063	The proximal MeSHD004602 of the MeSHD006801 MeSHD016633 promoter increases the enhancer activity of the distal region.	We have previously shown that MeSHD006801 MeSHD016633 (MeSHD016633) transcription is controlled by a complex set of regulatory MeSHD004602. In this study, we demonstrate that the distal region of the MeSHD016633 promoter (-911/-614) acts as an enhancer and results in a 6-fold increase in activity when the proximal AB MeSHD004602 is inserted between this enhancer and a MeSHD016385. The AB MeSHD004602 alone does not display any transcriptional activity. The combination of the proximal AB MeSHD004602 and the enhancer is sufficient to activate transcription to the same level as that achieved with the full-length promoter. MeSHD004247 binding and competition assays, and binding interference experiments allowed us to identify two adjacent MeSHD001665 within the AB MeSHD004602. These bind activities designated CIIIB1 and AIIAB3/4, respectively. MeSHD009154 on each of these sites showed that the MeSHD001665 of CIIIB1 within the AB MeSHD004602 played a major MeSHD012380 in the interaction with the enhancer. Whereas MeSHD015533 of other MeSHD001053 MeSHD005796 involves the binding of the MeSHD008099-enriched MeSHD051557 (HNF4) on their proximal promoter, the present study demonstrates that neither HNF4 nor MeSHD016632 regulatory MeSHD011506 1, its antagonistic MeSHD054540 receptor, was able to bind the AB MeSHD004602. Instead, MeSHD016633 transcription was driven by the interaction of MeSHD016633 enhancer with proximal AB MeSHD004602, which involves an unidentified activity, CIIIB1.
103	8025213	MeSHD016131 in MeSHD013950 and peripheral MeSHD008221 of MeSHD000375 and diabetic MeSHD016688.	The nonobese diabetic (NOD) MeSHD051379 spontaneously develops MeSHD003922. The MeSHD004194 is associated with a leucocytic infiltration of the MeSHD007515 of Langerhans and it is believed that during the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD003922, the MeSHD007328-secreting islet beta-MeSHD002477 are destroyed by autoreactive MeSHD013601. We investigated the alteration of MeSHD016131 in central and peripheral lymphoid organs of NOD MeSHD005260 MeSHD051379 with increasing age beginning before the onset of insulitis and ending well after the onset of diabetes. The MeSHD013154, inguinal and pancreatic MeSHD008198 all increased in MeSHD002452, especially after the onset of insulitis (8 weeks), and all decreased after the onset of diabetes. Flow cytometric studies showed a widening of the visible side scatter profile of MeSHD005260 NOD MeSHD008198 MeSHD002477 which coincided with the initiation of insulitis. Anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 double MeSHD013194 of MeSHD060168 revealed a large increase in the double negative MeSHD011153 and a corresponding decrease in the double positive MeSHD011153, but this occurred long after the onset of diabetes. Generally, there was an increase in the CD4:CD8 ratio in the peripheral lymphoid organs during the onset of insulitis which was largely due to an increase in the CD4 MeSHD013601 MeSHD011153 while the ratio decreased after the onset of diabetes. In the MeSHD013154 this was mostly due to an increase in CD8 MeSHD013601. The pancreatic MeSHD008198, which theoretically might reflect what is happening in the MeSHD010179, showed an unexpected decrease in MeSHD016424 MeSHD002452 and a decrease in MeSHD013601 (especially CD4 MeSHD013601), while B MeSHD002477 were increased.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
104	10385845	Expression of MeSHD016212 1 in MeSHD007969.	The expression of MeSHD016212 1, which has neurotrophic effects, was investigated in 25 MeSHD007231 with MeSHD007969 using MeSHD007150. In MeSHQ000517, MeSHD016212 1 immunoreactivity was not detected in the cerebral MeSHD066127 or cortex. Of the 25 cases of MeSHD007969, MeSHD016212 1 immunoreactivity was found in 16, and was distributed mainly in the MeSHD003593 of MeSHD001253, being prominent around necrotic foci in the MeSHD066127. The immunoreactivity was negative or weak at the acute stage of MeSHD007969, and increased at the subacute stage and then decreased or was absent at the chronic stage. MeSHD001253 that were moderately or markedly positive for MeSHD016212 1 were not found before 27 weeks' MeSHD011247, but were observed after 32 weeks' MeSHD011247 in the MeSHD066127 of the MeSHD001921 of MeSHD007231 with MeSHD007969. MeSHD016212 1 expression tended to be more obvious in focal MeSHD007969 than in widespread or diffuse MeSHD007969. Our results suggest that MeSHD016212 1 could be involved in the delayed glial response rather than the initial glial activation, and could MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in the inhibition and repair of MeSHD014947 in MeSHD007969. Exogenous MeSHD016212 1 could have MeSHD013812 potential for MeSHD007969.
105	10822467	MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD015464.	While the demonstrated MeSHD000998, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory properties of MeSHD007372 have led to a number of theories regarding their potential MeSHQ000706 in treating individuals with MeSHD015464 (CML), their limited availability has prevented thorough clinical investigation. However, in 1980, successful MeSHD019976 of the mature MeSHD006801 alpha-A MeSHD007372 led to the MeSHD004467 of large quantities of bacterially synthesized MeSHD006801 alpha-A MeSHD007372, now designated MeSHD000077190 (MeSHD000077190, Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). This abundance of alfa-2a made possible MeSHD000068397 of MeSHD016898's capacity to suppress CML MeSHD015143 (Ph1) MeSHD002999 as well as restore the MeSHD002477 with normal MeSHD059785. The data resulting from these MeSHD016430 indicate that MeSHD000077190 is effective in inducing hematologic remissions in the majority of minimally treated, benign-phase CML, Ph1-positive MeSHD010361. In some of the MeSHD010361, MeSHQ000628 resulted in MeSHD010677 suppression in the MeSHD001853 and in the emergence of MeSHD002477 with a normal MeSHD059785.
106	11939136	Cambridge Healthtech Institute's 2nd Annual Conference on MeSHD010597 MeSHD005060: presaging profits.	MeSHD010597 promises to offer distinct strategic advantages to MeSHD004364 companies, MeSHD010820, providers and MeSHD010361. Cambridge Healthtech Institute's 2nd Annual Conference on 'MeSHD010597 MeSHD005060: Presaging Profits' covered all aspects of MeSHD010597 and gave scientists from both academia and from MeSHD004364 and biotech companies a great opportunity to discuss the latest progress in pharmacogenomic MeSHD012106. The meeting considered MeSHD013672 for MeSHD020641 (SNP) MeSHQ000175 and expression profiling, MeSHD019295 tools for data evaluation and gave an overview on the state of affairs and novel approaches to implement MeSHD010597 and MeSHD010597 into MeSHD000076722 and medical MeSHQ000628. The major strength of the meeting was the merging of scientists from many different disciplines, such as clinicians, pharmacologists, molecular biologists, engineers and MeSHD019295 experts, into one meeting.
107	12065687	Effects and MeSHD012926 of MeSHD055513 on MeSHD055166.	MeSHD055513 (CTGF) is a 38-kd MeSHD011506 involved in several MeSHD006801 fibrotic disorders including MeSHD050197 and MeSHD012867 and renal MeSHD005355. Although it has been shown that MeSHD006801 and experimental MeSHD008103 is associated with CTGF expression through MeSHD015854 of CTGF MeSHD012333 by MeSHD055166 (HSC), the MeSHD012380 of CTGF in the MeSHD008099 has not yet been determined. The aim of the present study was to assess the effects of CTGF on MeSHD051381 primary HSC and its MeSHD012926 in a well-established model of MeSHD066298 MeSHD008099 fibrogenesis. Incubation of primary HSC with recombinant CTGF induced a significant migratory (2.3-fold, 50 ng/ml CTGF) and proliferative effect (1.8-fold, 100 ng/ml CTGF). MeSHD024042 MeSHD012333 expression, as assessed by a real-MeSHD013995 RT-MeSHD016133 MeSHD008722, was also increased when MeSHD002477 were incubated in the presence of CTGF (2-fold, 50 ng/ml). MeSHD053773 (MeSHD053773) strongly stimulated CTGF MeSHD012333 expression, a direct mechanism observed in the absence of any intermediate MeSHD011506 synthesis. Furthermore, spontaneous activation of HSC plated on MeSHD010969 and stimulation by MeSHD042461, MeSHD015227 products (HNE, MDA), MeSHD000079, and MeSHD010982 (PDGF)-BB significantly up-regulated CTGF MeSHD012333 expression in HSC. PDGF-induced CTGF stimulation might be related in part to MeSHD053773 MeSHQ000378 because CTGF MeSHD012333 MeSHD015854 observed after MeSHD000077214 stimulation was abrogated in the presence of neutralizing MeSHD053773 antibody. In conclusion, this study extends the MeSHD012380 of CTGF in HSC activation and suggests that CTGF MeSHD015854 might be a central pathway during HSC activation.
108	11114264	Cellular expression of MeSHD064569 MeSHD011506 in the MeSHD013702 in Alzheimer's and MeSHD010300--a stereological approach.	Cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's and MeSHD010300 are closely related to disturbed MeSHD018678 MeSHQ000635. The decrease of MeSHD011978 MeSHD011506 has been assessed by MeSHD015153 and MeSHD007150. Stereology, however, has not been used to assess numbers of receptor-expressing MeSHD006801 cerebrocortical MeSHD009474. Our approach applies a combination of alpha7 subunit-MeSHD007150 with a stereological technique using defined stretches of pial surface as MeSHD012015. The number of alpha7 subunit MeSHD011506-expressing MeSHD009474 in the Alzheimer MeSHD013702 amounted to approximately half of that of MeSHQ000517 while numbers in Parkinson MeSHD010361 lay in between. No differences in the total number of MeSHD009474 were seen. These results corroborate nonstereological studies on Alzheimer cortices and for the first MeSHD013995 show a similar decrease in receptor expression in MeSHD010300. They provide evidence that not only MeSHD000544 but also cognitive deficits in MeSHD010300 may be related to decreased MeSHD011978 expression.
109	8176570	Endotracheal colonization with MeSHD002175 enhances MeSHD012306 of MeSHC536777 in MeSHD019102 MeSHD007231.	To determine whether MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD002175 from an endotracheal aspirate identifies a MeSHD011153 of MeSHD019102 (VLBW; < or = 1500 gm) MeSHD007231 at increased MeSHD012306 of MeSHC536777. Prospective evaluation with weekly MeSHQ000208 of endotracheal and rectal specimens to determine colonization status. One hundred sixteen VLBW MeSHD007231 (mean MeSHD001724, 975 +/- 23 gm, estimated MeSHD005865, 27.6 +/- 0.2 weeks) with endotracheal tubes in place who were admitted to a level III nursery between Jan. 8 and Dec. 2, 1992. Of the 116 subjects, 39 MeSHD007223 were colonized with MeSHD002175 (34%). Thirteen MeSHD007231 had MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD002175 in one or more MeSHQ000208 of endotracheal specimens. Eleven of these could be examined, and in five systemic MeSHD004194 developed (MeSHD004194 in 5/11 vs 2/26; MeSHD012306 = 5.9; 95% MeSHD016001, 1.34 to 26). Eight MeSHD007223 were colonized with MeSHD002175 in the first week of MeSHD019369. Seven of these could be examined, and in five MeSHC536777 developed (MeSHD004194 in 5/7 vs 2/30; RR = 9.3; 95% MeSHD016001, 2.3 to 38.0). Colonization with MeSHD002175 occurs frequently in VLBW MeSHD007223. Progression from colonization to systemic MeSHD007239 is more common in the smallest MeSHD007231. Detection of colonization in the first week of MeSHD019369 or the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD002175 from an endotracheal aspirate identifies a group of VLBW MeSHD007231 with an endotracheal tube in place whose MeSHD012306 of MeSHC536777 is increased. A prospective trial of intervention in this high-MeSHD012306 MeSHD011153 is warranted.
110	8159245	Anchoring of MeSHD017868 is required for modulation of MeSHD018350/MeSHD018092 on hippocampal MeSHD009474.	MeSHD010766 of molecules involved in MeSHD009435 by multifunctional MeSHD011494 modulates both pre- and post-synaptic events in the MeSHD002490. The positioning of MeSHD010770 near their substrates may be an important part of the regulatory mechanism. The MeSHD054758 (AKAPs; ref. 3) are known to bind the regulatory subunit of MeSHD017868 A with nanomolar affinity. Here we show that anchoring of MeSHD017868 by AKAPs is required for the modulation of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-MeSHD007555-MeSHC029658 (MeSHD018350)/MeSHD007608 channels. Intracellular MeSHD010477 of cultured hippocampal MeSHD009474 with MeSHD010455 derived from the conserved MeSHD010770 binding region of AKAPs prevented the MeSHD017868-mediated MeSHD012926 of MeSHD018350/MeSHD007608 currents as well as fast excitatory synaptic currents. This effect could be overcome by adding the purified MeSHD020134 of MeSHD011494. A MeSHQ000517 MeSHD010455 lacking MeSHD010770-binding activity had no effect. To our MeSHD019359, these results provide the first evidence that anchoring of MeSHD017868 is crucial in the MeSHD012926 of synaptic MeSHQ000502.
111	9537061	MeSHD000941-initiated MeSHD001402 differentiation. XVII. The inhibitory effects of recent MeSHD000941 prepriming on the subsequent responsiveness of 'pre-progenitor' B MeSHD002477.	We have analysed the MeSHD014171 unresponsiveness of B MeSHD002477 following specific MeSHD000941 prepriming. The effect is restricted to MeSHD019264 antibody-forming MeSHD002477 (AFC) progenitors (that is, 'pre-progenitors') and does not occur with the separate subset of MeSHD018929 AFC progenitors ('direct progenitors'). The MeSHD014171 unresponsiveness is displayed by both primary and MeSHQ000556 'pre-progenitor' B MeSHD002477. Mixing experiments and experiments with MeSHD008819 indicate that the effect is not due to suppressor MeSHD013601 or other inhibitory MeSHD002477. Nor is the effect due to an impaired seeding MeSHD001076 of the activated or MeSHD000941-binding MeSHD002477, since after MeSHD019264 the preprimed MeSHD002477 can be activated by an appropriate non-specific stimulus. The most likely explanation involves direct interaction of specific MeSHD000941 with the MeSHD011946 on 'pre-progenitor' B MeSHD002477, rendering these MeSHD002477 more prone to temporary or permanent 'tolerance' on further MeSHD000941 contact or, alternatively, directing their differentiation away from MeSHD007075 AFC MeSHD004467 on day 8 after transfer.
112	8534917	MeSHD014747 suppresses dynamics of individual MeSHD008870 in living MeSHD007399 MeSHD002477.	We have characterized the effects of MeSHD014747 on the dynamic instability MeSHD001519 of individual MeSHD008870 in living BS-C-1 MeSHD002477 microinjected with MeSHD012235-labeled MeSHD014404 and have found that at low concentrations (3-64 nM), MeSHD014747 potently suppresses dynamic instability without causing net MeSHD008870 depolymerization. MeSHD014747 suppressed the rates of MeSHD008870 MeSHQ000254 and shortening, and decreased the MeSHQ000453 of transitions from MeSHQ000254 or pause to shortening, also called catastrophe. In MeSHD014747-treated MeSHD002477, both the average duration of a pause (a state of attenuated dynamics where neither MeSHQ000254 nor shortening could be detected) and the percentage of total MeSHD013995 spent in pause were significantly increased. MeSHD014747 potently decreased dynamicity, a MeSHD014894 of the MeSHD016424 dynamic activity of MeSHD008870, reducing this parameter by 75% at 32 nM. The present MeSHD014937, consistent with earlier MeSHD066298 studies, demonstrates that MeSHD014747 kinetically caps the ends of MeSHD008870 in living MeSHD002477 and supports the hypothesis that the potent chemotherapeutic action of MeSHD014747 as an MeSHD000970 is suppression of MeSHD008941 MeSHD008870 dynamics. Further, the results indicate that molecules that bind to MeSHD008870 ends can regulate MeSHD008870 dynamic MeSHD001519 in living MeSHD002477 and suggest that endogenous regulators of MeSHD008870 dynamics that MeSHD014937 by similar mechanisms may exist in living MeSHD002477.
113	12438462	MeSHD057565 in MeSHD010300.	To assess MeSHD057565 in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010300 and its relation to disability, MeSHD000339, MeSHD010551, and MeSHD003071. Levels of MeSHD057565 in 45 MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010300 were compared with a group of 17 similarly disabled MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010003. Additional neuropsychiatric data were collected concerning levels of MeSHD003863, MeSHD001007, and hedonic tone. MeSHD010551 was assessed with the tridimensional MeSHD010551 MeSHD011795. MeSHD009483 included the MeSHD000073216, the Cambridge examination of MeSHD003071 in the MeSHD000368, and specific tests of executive functioning. MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010300 had significantly higher levels of MeSHD057565 than equally disabled osteoarthritic MeSHD010361. Furthermore, within the Parkinson sample, levels of MeSHD057565 appear to be unrelated to MeSHD018450. The MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010300 with the highest levels of MeSHD057565 where not more likely to be depressed or anxious than those with the lowest levels of MeSHD057565, though they did show reduced hedonic tone. No differences in MeSHD010551 traits were detected in comparisons between MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010300 and MeSHD010003, or between MeSHD010361 in the Parkinson group with high or low levels of MeSHD057565. As a group, the MeSHD010361 with MeSHD010300 tended not to differ significantly from the osteoarthritic group in terms of cognitive skills. However, within the MeSHD010300 sample, the high MeSHD057565 MeSHD010361 performed significantly below the level of the low MeSHD057565 MeSHD010361. This was particularly evident on tests of executive functioning. MeSHD057565 in MeSHD010300 is more likely to be a direct consequence of MeSHD004194 related physiological changes than a psychological reaction or adaptation to disability. MeSHD057565 in MeSHD010300 can be distinguished from other psychiatric MeSHQ000175 and MeSHD010551 features that are associated with the MeSHD004194, and it is closely associated with MeSHD060825. These MeSHQ000175 point to a possible MeSHD012380 of cognitive mechanisms in the expression of MeSHD057565.
114	11741598	Clearance of MeSHD054509 via MeSHD051379 MeSHD010740 A(2) receptor.	Given the potent hydrolyzing activity toward MeSHD010713, MeSHD054509 (MeSHD054509) elicits a marked release of MeSHD016718 linked to the potent MeSHD004467 of MeSHD008055 mediators in various MeSHD002477 types. We have recently shown that MeSHD054509 can also act as a MeSHD008024 for MeSHD051379 MeSHD010740 A(2) receptor (PLA(2)R). Here, we found that MeSHD054509 was internalized and degraded via binding to PLA(2)R associated with the diminished MeSHD011453 E(2) (MeSHD011458(2)) formation in PLA(2)R-expressing MeSHD003412 MeSHD010053 (CHO) MeSHD002477 compared to MeSHD016466. Indirect immunocytochemical MeSHQ000032 revealed that internalized MeSHD054509 was co-localized with PLA(2)R in the punctate structures in PLA(2)R-expressing MeSHD016466. Moreover, in MeSHD051379 osteoblastic MC3T3-E(1) MeSHD002477 that endogenously express the PLA(2)R, the internalized MeSHD054509 was localized in MeSHD008247. These MeSHQ000175 demonstrate that PLA(2)R acts as a clearance receptor for MeSHD054509 to suppress its strong enzymatic activity.
115	12706854	Tart cherry MeSHD000872 inhibit MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 in Apc(Min) MeSHD051379 and reduce proliferation of MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 MeSHD002477.	MeSHD000872, which are bioactive MeSHD064209, are widely distributed in MeSHD010944 and especially enriched in tart cherries. Based on previous MeSHD019370 that tart cherry MeSHD000872 and their respective aglycone, MeSHC017154, can inhibit MeSHD011451 MeSHD004798, we conducted experiments to test the potential of MeSHD000872 to inhibit intestinal MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 in Apc(Min) MeSHD051379 and MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 MeSHD002460. MeSHD051379 consuming the cherry MeSHD004032, MeSHD000872, or MeSHC017154 had significantly fewer and smaller cecal MeSHD000236 than MeSHD051379 consuming the MeSHQ000517 MeSHD004032 or MeSHD013467. Colonic MeSHD009369 numbers and volume were not significantly influenced by MeSHQ000628. MeSHD000872 and MeSHC017154 also reduced MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 MeSHD002460 HT 29 and HCT 116. The IC(50) of MeSHD000872 and MeSHC017154 was 780 and 63 microM for MeSHD019073, respectively and 285 and 85 microM for MeSHD045325, respectively. These results suggest that tart cherry MeSHD000872 and MeSHC017154 may reduce the MeSHD012306 of MeSHD003110.
116	12055189	MeSHD053669 mediates adhesion and proliferation of MeSHD003106 MeSHD002277 MeSHD002477.	MeSHD053669 is a transmembrane MeSHD019812 whose MeSHQ000502 at the MeSHD002477 surface is unclear. In this study, we examined the MeSHQ000502 of MeSHD053669 in MeSHD003110 MeSHD002460. In several MeSHD003110 MeSHD002460, MeSHD053669 was highly expressed compared with normal MeSHD002460. In contrast, MeSHD053668 and -4 were decreased. MeSHD002477 MeSHD001688 studies using the extracellular domain of recombinant MeSHD053669 (2E) or spreading MeSHQ000032 with MeSHD053669 antibody-coated plates showed that MeSHD053669 mediated adhesion and cytoskeletal MeSHD009938 of MeSHD003110 MeSHD002477. This interaction was critical for the proliferation of MeSHD003106 MeSHD002277 MeSHD002477. Blocking with 2E or antisense MeSHD053669 MeSHD018076 induced G(0)/G(1) MeSHD059447 with concomitantly increased expression of p21, p27, and p53. Furthermore, blocking of MeSHD053669 through antisense MeSHD053669 MeSHD018076 significantly reduced tumorigenic activity in MeSHD003106 MeSHD002277 MeSHD002477. Therefore, increased MeSHD053669 expression appears to be a critical for MeSHD003106 MeSHD002277 MeSHD002477 MeSHD001519, and MeSHD053669 regulates tumorigenic activity through MeSHD012926 of adhesion and proliferation in MeSHD003106 MeSHD002277 MeSHD002477.
117	9624526	The MeSHD036801 of the blended MeSHD003479.	In the struggle to survive economically, our MeSHD005194 MeSHD007396 MeSHD019542 developed a new MeSHD003479 that incorporated MeSHD004602 of both the conventional rotational model and the newer longitudinal mode. We also created unique MeSHD004602: MeSHD007101 weeks, subspecialty clinics, and Tuesday specials. MeSHD007101 weeks provide focused exposures to specialty areas. The resident brings learned skills MeSHD001415 to the MeSHD005194 clinic (FPC). Subspecialty clinics in the FPC bring MeSHD013038 to the residents and to the residents' MeSHD010361 for reinforcement of learned skills. Tuesday specials provide longitudinal experiences in geriatric, MeSHD012111, and MeSHD009787. The blended MeSHD003479 has been a success with both MeSHD007396 Assistance MeSHD019542 MeSHD003253 and the MeSHD007396 MeSHD026683 reviewer. It has also increased residents' availability to see MeSHD010361 in the FPC and increased FPC MeSHD007182.
118	8938265	MeSHD011972 MeSHD012333 in the MeSHD013378 in MeSHD010300.	Neurotrophic effects resulting from the MeSHD007328/MeSHD011972 system have been recognized as important in determining the etiological basis of MeSHD019636. In MeSHD010300, selective neuronal loss in the MeSHD013378 is accompanied by decreased immunoreactivity of the MeSHD011972 as determined using immunohistochemical studies. We performed semiquantitative MeSHD012333 MeSHQ000032 by MeSHD048348-MeSHD016133 (RT-MeSHD016133) using specific primers for MeSHD006801 MeSHD011972 MeSHD005091 22, which encodes a region of the beta subunit of the receptor serving as a MeSHD011505 domain. The relative levels of MeSHD012333 in the MeSHD013378 from Parkinson's MeSHD001921 MeSHD014024 showed a marked MeSHD003863 compared with those of normal MeSHQ000517. Further investigations are needed to decide whether this is a primary, MeSHD004194-specific alteration of MeSHD015870 or merely a MeSHQ000556 process.
119	11139194	MeSHD000911 to conformational MeSHD000939 of the MeSHD008562 of MeSHD016088: potential application to competitive-inhibition MeSHD004797 for detecting MeSHD000906 in MeSHD006041 sera.	Four MeSHD007136 G1 MeSHD000911 (MAbs) to the gp135 surface envelope MeSHD006023 (SU) of the 79-63 isolate of MeSHD016088 (MeSHD016088), referred to as MeSHD016088-63, were characterized and evaluated for their MeSHD001076 to compete with antibody from MeSHD016088-infected MeSHD006041. Three MeSHD051189 MAbs (MAbs GPB16A, 29A, and 74A) and one caprine MAb (MAb F7-299) were examined. All MAbs reacted in MeSHD003101 dot blots with native MeSHD016088-63 SU purified by MAb F7-299 MeSHD002846, whereas none reacted with denatured and reduced SU. All MAbs reacted in MeSHD015153 with purified MeSHD016088-63 SU or the SU component of whole-MeSHD014780 lysate following denaturation in the absence of MeSHD019163, indicating that intramolecular MeSHD004220 bonding was essential for MeSHD000939 integrity. MeSHD017038 MeSHD004063 of SU abolished the reactivities of MAbs 74A and F7-299, whereas MeSHQ000628 of SU with N-acetylneuraminate MeSHD006026 (MeSHD009439 A) under nonreducing conditions enhanced the reactivities of all MAbs as well as polyclonal MeSHD006041 sera. MAbs 29A and F7-299 were cross-reactive with the SU of an independent MeSHD013180 of MeSHD016088 (MeSHD016088-Co). By MeSHD004797 (MeSHD004797), the reactivities of MeSHD006735 (HRP)-conjugated MAbs 16A and 29A with homologous MeSHD016088-63 SU were <10% of that of HRP-conjugated MAb 74A. The reactivity of HRP-conjugated MAb 74A was blocked by sera from MeSHD006041 immunized with MeSHD016088-63 SU or infected with MeSHD016088-63. The reactivity of MAb 74A was also blocked by sera from MeSHD006041 infected with a MeSHD016088-Co molecular MeSHD002999, although MAb 74A did not react with MeSHD016088-Co SU in MeSHD015153. Thus, MeSHD006041 infected with either MeSHD016088-63 or MeSHD016088-Co make MeSHD000906 that inhibit binding of MAb 74A to MeSHD016088-63 SU. A competitive-inhibition MeSHD004797 based on displacement of MAb 74A reactivity has potential applicability for the serologic MeSHD003933 of MeSHD016088 MeSHD007239.
120	7487082	MeSHQ000302 of the MeSHD011125 (APC) MeSHD005796 product.	MeSHD009154 of the MeSHD011125 (APC) MeSHD005796 is responsible for MeSHD011125 and is an etiologic factor for MeSHD041981 MeSHD009369. Although the MeSHD017491 product (APC) is believed to MeSHD010988 a MeSHD012380 in MeSHQ000254 suppression of colonocytes, the underlying mechanism is not clear. However, recent evidence does suggest that APC is a MeSHD008869 (MAP), and like other MAPs, it can be phosphorylated, as we have shown. To facilitate studies of APC MeSHQ000502, we purified the APC MeSHD011506. To purify the full-length APC MeSHD011506, HCT116 MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 MeSHD002477 were lysed and the particulate fraction from the lysate was extracted with MeSHD000645 followed by MeSHD012685 and MeSHC007369-Sephacel column fractionation and then by MeSHD013395 MeSHD015725 MeSHD002499. The final purified APC fraction was determined to be about 1000-fold enriched in APC. The availability of purified APC MeSHD014836 be valuable in investigating possible MeSHQ000254-suppressing mechanisms of APC including specific sites of APC MeSHD010766 and APC's interaction with other cellular MeSHD011506.
121	8960360	MeSHQ000032 of interactions between the subunits of MeSHD047390.	MeSHD047390, which was formerly known as MeSHD047390, is a highly conserved MeSHD011506 MeSHD012694/MeSHD017346 implicated in the MeSHQ000517 of MeSHD049109 through its MeSHD010766 of regulatory MeSHD009687. The MeSHD004798 consists of catalytic (alpha and (or) alpha') subunits and beta subunits that modulate the activity of the MeSHD020134. These subunits are arranged in homotetrameric (i.e., alpha 2 beta 2 or alpha' 2 beta 2) or heterotetrameric (i.e., alpha alpha' beta 2) complexes. We previously demonstrated using the MeSHD020798 that alpha (or alpha') subunits can interact with beta subunits but not other alpha (or alpha') subunits. By comparison, beta subunits can interact with alpha (or alpha') and with beta subunits, suggesting that the MeSHD047390 MeSHD020035 MeSHD020478 because of the MeSHD001076 of beta subunits to dimerize, bringing two heterodimers (alpha beta or alpha' beta) into a tetrameric complex. In the present study, we used the MeSHD020798 to examine the domains of interactions between the alpha and beta subunits of MeSHD047390. These studies indicate that the MeSHD001076 of beta to interact with alpha resides within the carboxy-terminal domain of beta. By comparison, our studies suggest that individual domains of alpha are not sufficient for interactions with beta.
122	8275421	Low rate of ret MeSHD011519 activation (PTC/retTPC) in MeSHD000077273 from MeSHD012529.	The ret MeSHD011519 activation (PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857) in MeSHD013961 MeSHD002291 has been reported in different MeSHD011153 with different MeSHQ000453. MeSHD013961 MeSHD002291 appears to behave more aggressively in the MeSHD019156 region than elsewhere. In the current study, the MeSHQ000453 of PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857 in MeSHD013961 MeSHD009369 from MeSHD012529 was investigated. PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857 transcripts were analyzed by the MeSHD016133 amplification of MeSHD018076 synthesized by MeSHQ000628 of total MeSHD012313 with MeSHD012194. Seven multinodular MeSHD006042, 1 MeSHD000236, 4 follicular MeSHD002277, 40 MeSHD002291, and 5 MeSHD002277 were studied. Only one MeSHD002291 specimen was found to have PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857 transcripts. The breakpoint of the rearranged PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857 is identical to that previously described. The PTC/retTPC-positive sample was also examined for p53 MeSHD016147 MeSHD009154 in MeSHD005091 5-8. One transitional MeSHD017354 was detected at MeSHD003062 161 (GCC to ACC), changing Ala to Thr. This study questions the relevance of PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857 in the MeSHD063646 of MeSHD013961 MeSHD002291 in the Saudi MeSHD011153. MeSHD000068617 among MeSHD044469 may contribute to the different MeSHQ000453 of PTC/retTPC MeSHD009857 in MeSHD013961 MeSHD002291.
123	11072645	[Rare and atypical MeSHD020478 of MeSHD008881].	The rare MeSHD020478 of MeSHD008881 should be studied so that they can be recognized, thereby avoiding MeSHD003951 and unnecessary complementary investigations. These rare MeSHD020478 can be divided into three categories: 1) atypical MeSHD004827, characterized by the following: their semiology (visual or sensory MeSHD007088 or MeSHD006212); their manner of onset (sudden onset of MeSHD004827, with MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD008881 in under four minutes); their duration (MeSHD004827 prolonged for between 60 minutes and seven days); MeSHD004827 with absence of accompanying MeSHD006261. This MeSHD020478 of MeSHD008881 could be confused with a case of MeSHD004828 or AIT and raises a problem of MeSHD003937 requiring an etiological investigation to ensure correct MeSHD003933; 2) clinical MeSHD020478 which are for the most part recognized by the International MeSHD006261 Society's (IHS) MeSHD002965, i.e., MeSHD020325, MeSHD020325, MeSHD060486 and the rare MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD012172 MeSHD008881. Confusional MeSHD008881, a disorder which is mainly encountered in childhood, has not been categorized by the IHS but may be part of the symptomatology of the above-described MeSHD020478; and 3) MeSHQ000556 MeSHD008881, in which a triggering mechanism MeSHQ000209 MeSHD008881 attacks to appear in a subject who was not previously affected by this disorder. This category covers post-traumatic MeSHD008881, MeSHD008881 of cervical origin, the co-MeSHD009017 of MeSHD008881 and MeSHD012640, and rare cases of symptomatic MeSHD008881 which are indicative of underlying general MeSHD004194 or an intracranial lesion, i.e., a MeSHD009369 or MeSHD001165.
124	8109990	[Genetic alterations of MeSHD006801 MeSHD015179].	Genetic alterations of several MeSHD009857 and MeSHD016147 are associated with MeSHD006801 colorectal MeSHD063646. Especially in MeSHD009154, the K-ras, p53, APC and MeSHD016163 frequently occurred, and these MeSHD005796 alterations seem to have important MeSHD012380 in colorectal MeSHD063646. We investigated 28 MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 specimens obtained from MeSHQ000601 and five MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 MeSHD002460 by MeSHD016133-MeSHD018807 MeSHQ000032, MeSHD016133-OSH MeSHQ000032, RT-MeSHD016133 or sequencing MeSHD008722. Forty percent of MeSHD009369 from surgical specimens had Ki-ras 2 (MeSHD003062 12/13), p53 (MeSHD005091 5-8), APC (MCR) MeSHD005796 MeSHD009154, and fifty-seven percent of them had lower expression of MeSHD016163 that of normal matched MeSHD003106 MeSHD009092 of the same MeSHD010361. G to A transition was the most frequent in K-ras mutational spectrum in this case; 25% of MeSHD010361 had both k-ras and MeSHD016158 MeSHD017354. MeSHD020478 the results, we concluded that it in colorectal MeSHD063646 for both K-ras and MeSHD016158 MeSHD017354 might not necessary occur.
125	7854378	MeSHD001244 between MeSHD000073865 and MeSHD009154 of the MeSHD016158 in MeSHD000077195.	Although MeSHD016021 have long associated MeSHD014026 and alcohol MeSHQ000706 with the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD000077195, the molecular targets of these MeSHD002273 have yet to be identified. We performed a molecular MeSHQ000032 to determine the pattern of MeSHD009154 in the MeSHD016158 in MeSHD009369 from MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000077195 and a MeSHQ000266 of MeSHD014026 or alcohol MeSHQ000706. MeSHD017421 of the conserved regions of the MeSHD016158 was performed in MeSHD009369 samples from 129 MeSHD010361 with primary MeSHD000077195. We then used statistical MeSHQ000032 to identify any MeSHD010361 characteristics associated with MeSHD009154 of the MeSHD016158. We found p53 MeSHD009154 in 42 percent of the MeSHD010361 (54 of 129). Fifty-eight percent of the MeSHD010361 who smoked MeSHD062789 and used alcohol (37 of 64; 95 percent MeSHD016001, 45 to 70 percent), 33 percent of the MeSHD010361 who smoked but abstained from alcohol (13 of 39; 95 percent MeSHD016001, 19 to 50 percent), and 17 percent of the MeSHD010361 who neither smoked nor drank alcohol (4 of 24, 95 percent MeSHD016001, 5 to 37 percent) had p53 MeSHD009154 (P = 0.001). (Two MeSHD010361 used alcohol but did not MeSHD012906, and neither had a p53 MeSHD009154.) Furthermore, 100 percent of the MeSHD009154 in the MeSHD010361 who neither drank nor smoked occurred at sites containing MeSHD003562 MeSHD010710 MeSHD006151 dinucleotides (potentially representing endogenous MeSHD009154) within the MeSHD016158 (5 of 5 MeSHD009154; 95 percent MeSHD016001, 48 to 100 percent), whereas only 23 percent of those in MeSHD062789 MeSHD000074285 consisted of such changes (12 of 53 MeSHD009154; 95 percent MeSHD016001, 12 to 36 percent; P = 0.001). In our study, a MeSHQ000266 of MeSHD014026 and alcohol MeSHQ000706 was associated with a high MeSHQ000453 of p53 MeSHD009154 in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000077195. Preliminary evidence linked MeSHD000073865 to p53 MeSHD009154 at nonendogenous MeSHD009154 sites. Our MeSHQ000175 suggest a MeSHD012380 for MeSHD014026 in the molecular progression of MeSHD000077195 and support the epidemiologic evidence that abstinence from MeSHD012907 is important to prevent MeSHD006258.
126	10961047	[MeSHD006816. A MeSHD016454].	MeSHD006816 (HD) is a hereditary autosomal dominant MeSHD019636 characterized by motor, cognitive and psychiatric MeSHQ000175. It MeSHD000339 about 1 in 10,000 individuals. The onset of MeSHQ000175 typically occurs in the third or fourth decade of MeSHD019369, though it may appear at any age. The molecular basis of the MeSHD004194 is the expansion of the trinucleotide CAG in the first MeSHD005091 of a MeSHD005796 on MeSHD002875 four (4p 16.3). This MeSHD005796 encodes the MeSHD011506 huntingtin of 3136 MeSHD000596. The MeSHD009154 of huntingtin produces an expanded stretch of MeSHD005973 (Gln) residues. This CAG/polyGln expansion has 6 to 39 units in normal individuals and 36 to 180 units in HD MeSHD010361. The normal MeSHQ000502 of huntingtin and the pathogenic mechanisms caused by the expanded polyGln of mutant huntingtin remain incompletely characterized. Huntingtin appears to be associated with MeSHD013572 and/or MeSHD008870 and seems to have an important MeSHD012380 in vesicular transport and/or the binding to the MeSHD003599. It is MeSHD013850 that this MeSHD011506 is important in MeSHD047108 and that its mutant MeSHD020478 alters the MeSHQ000502 of the mitochondrial MeSHD004579. The toxic gain of MeSHQ000502 caused by huntingtin could either be an overactivity of the normal MeSHQ000502 or the introduction of a novel MeSHQ000502. Its interactions with other MeSHD011506 could MeSHD007854 to an impairment of the cellular MeSHQ000502 or to its own MeSHD058105 to MeSHD020478 insoluble aggregates. The intraneuronal aggregates could MeSHD000339 MeSHD005796 transcription, MeSHD011506 interactions, MeSHD021381 inside the nucleus and MeSHD003593, and the vesicular transport. However, since a MeSHD004213 between the aggregation of huntingtin and the selective pattern of striatal neuronal loss has been demonstrated, it is believed that other properties of the mutant huntingtin, like MeSHD059748 and the interactions with other MeSHD011506 that MeSHD000339 vesicular trafficking and MeSHD021581, could be responsible for the neurodegeneration. On gross examination, 80% of HD MeSHD001921 show MeSHD001284 of the MeSHD005625. A bilateral, symmetric MeSHD001284 of the striatum is observed in 95% of the HD MeSHD001921. The mean MeSHD001921 weight in HD MeSHD010361 is approximately 30% lower than in normal individuals. Striatal degeneration has an ordered and topographic MeSHQ000600. The MeSHD013623 of the MeSHD002421 shows more degeneration than the MeSHD006257. The caudate MeSHD001284 is associated to a gradual MeSHD001284 and neuronal loss in other MeSHD001921 regions as the MeSHD004194 progresses. The striatal and MeSHD002540 MeSHD011385 MeSHD009474 are much more susceptible to the MeSHD004194 than MeSHD007395. In the MeSHD017072, the levels of MeSHD005680, MeSHD004399 and MeSHD013373 are decreased, but the concentrations of MeSHD013004 and MeSHD009478 increase. An impairment of MeSHD004734 in HD and a MeSHD012680 to MeSHD018384 and to the cytotoxic effects of MeSHD018698 seem to contribute to the neuronal MeSHD003643 in HD. It is proposed that MeSHD008550 should be assayed in MeSHD018929 and in MeSHD030801 due to its potent MeSHD000975 and MeSHD016166 properties.
127	10488185	MeSHD012698 of MeSHD020031 by using recombinant viral MeSHD002213 MeSHD000941 fragments and autologous MeSHD050939.	Using recombinant 15- to 30-kDa fragments and fusion with MeSHD005982 (GST), we investigated the seroreactivity of three large structural MeSHD011506 of MeSHD004854 (MeSHD004854), p150 (BcLF1, MeSHD002213), p143 (BNRF1, tegument), and gp125 (BALF4, MeSHD008566) in MeSHD015153. None of 13 fragments tested, however, was qualified for diagnostic application. In contrast, the two small viral MeSHD002213 MeSHD000941 (VCA), p18 (BFRF3) and p23 (BLRF2), demonstrated sensitive (100%) MeSHD004854-specific MeSHD007074 (MeSHD007074) reactivities. While p18 additionally showed maximum MeSHD012680 for MeSHD007075 detection, the MeSHD007075 MeSHD012680 of p23 was restricted (44%). An autologous fusion MeSHD011506, p23-p18, which consists N-terminally of full-length p23, followed by the carboxy half of p18, was constructed. This MeSHD000941 was subjected to indirect VCA MeSHD004797 (MeSHD004797), for MeSHD007074 and MeSHD007075, as well as to a micro-capture (microc) MeSHD007075 MeSHD004797. All assays were found to be 100% specific when MeSHD004854-negative sera were tested. Using sera from previously infected individuals, the p23-p18 fusion revealed an improved MeSHD007074 MeSHD012680 of 99% compared to MeSHD012680 of 97 and 93% for the single MeSHD000941 p18 and p23, respectively. The MeSHD012680 of the indirect MeSHD007075 MeSHD004797 with samples of primary and past MeSHD007239, respectively, were 100%. The microc principle for MeSHD007075 overcame completely the interference by MeSHD012217. Compared to the MeSHD012680 of the indirect MeSHD007075 version, the MeSHD012680 with sera collected from MeSHD001172 MeSHD010361 increased from 48 to 100%. In summary, the p23-p18 MeSHD007074 and microc MeSHD007075 MeSHD004797 showed excellent performances and are promising new MeSHD003955 for the detection of MeSHD004854-specific MeSHD000998 MeSHD002213 MeSHD000906.
128	11254127	The MeSHD018833 GroEL and other MeSHD006360, besides DnaK, participate in MeSHD012270 biogenesis in MeSHD004926.	It has been shown that in MeSHD004926 the chaperone DnaK is necessary for the late stages of 50S and 30S MeSHD054657 assembly in vivo. Here we focus on the MeSHD012380 of other HSPs (MeSHD006360), including the MeSHD018833 GroEL, in addition to DnaK, in MeSHD012270 biogenesis at high MeSHD013696. GroEL is shown to be required for the very late 45S-->50S step in the biogenesis of the MeSHD054658, but not for 30S assembly. Interestingly, overproduction of GroES/GroEL can partially compensate for a lack of DnaK/DnaJ at 44 degrees C.
129	8136716	Modern advances in MeSHD008853: from MeSHD000818 to atom.	The ultimate MeSHD006040 of the modern physiologist is to understand and integrate the MeSHD001671, MeSHD001703 and MeSHQ000502 of undisturbed living MeSHD002477. To accomplish this MeSHD006040 requires the MeSHQ000254 and application of approaches that can non-invasively probe a variety of dynamic cellular processes. Although no technique is truly non-invasive, recently developed MeSHQ000379 are approaching this objective. MeSHD005453 has become the most popular optical tool for measuring the ion properties inside living MeSHD002477, due to MeSHD012680, MeSHD012680, and spatial and temporal resolution. All of these systems MeSHQ000706 the same basic principle, i.e., the MeSHD002477 or MeSHD014024 is exposed to a concentrated specific beam of excitation MeSHD008027 and the resultant fluorescent signal is detected on a MeSHD020471 MeSHD004864. Photomultiplier tube systems MeSHD014836 give maximal temporal resolution. Intensified video camera systems allow for maximal spatial resolution, and simultaneous measurement of fields of MeSHD002477. Improved spatial resolution can be obtained using confocal microscopes providing both 2D and 3D molecular MeSHQ000600 and activity MeSHD019532 from within MeSHD002477. In addition to obtaining spatial information from within MeSHD002477, it is now possible to MeSHD014894 dynamic surface morphometric changes with Angstrom level resolution using the technique of MeSHD018625 (AFM). This MeSHD016454 MeSHD014836 summarize the different MeSHQ000706 of both conventional and nonconventional MeSHD008853 to examine dynamic changes in living MeSHD002477.

No MeSHD009154 was found in 31 cases of sporadic MeSHD010051 and 1 case of hereditary site-specific MeSHD010051. BRCA1 MeSHD009154 was probably closely related to hereditary MeSHD001940-MeSHD010051 MeSHD013577. Detection of MeSHD019398 MeSHD009154 was helpful to MeSHD003933 HBOC MeSHD005190.
131	9690867	Functional characterization of a mutated MeSHD002645 MeSHD064569 subunit with a MeSHD007930 residue inserted in transmembrane domain 2.	1. MeSHD016297 was used to create an altered MeSHD020478 of the MeSHD002645 alpha7 nicotinic MeSHD000109 (ACh) receptor subunit (alpha7x61) in which a MeSHD007930 residue was inserted between residues Leu9' and Ser10' in transmembrane domain 2. The properties of alpha7x61 receptors are distinct from those of the wild-type receptor. 2. MeSHD009865 expressing wild-type alpha7 receptors responded to 10 microM MeSHD009538 with rapid inward currents that desensitized with a MeSHD013995-constant of 710+/-409 ms (mean+/-s.e.mean, n=5). However in alpha7x61 receptors 10 microM MeSHD009538 resulted in slower onset inward currents that desensitized with a MeSHD013995-constant of 5684+/-3403 ms (mean+/-s.e.mean, n = 4). No significant difference in the apparent affinity of MeSHD009538 or MeSHD000109 between mutant and wild-type receptors was observed. MeSHD004079 (DHbetaE) acted as an antagonist on both receptors. 3. Molecular modelling of the alpha7x61 receptor channel pore formed by a bundle of M2 MeSHD000072756 suggested that three of the channel lining residues would be altered by the MeSHD007930 insertion i.e.; Ser10 would be replaced by the MeSHD007930 insertion, Val13' and Phe14' would be replaced, by Thr and Val, respectively. 4 When present in the LEV-1 nicotinic MeSHD011950 subunit from MeSHD017173 the same alteration conferred resistance to MeSHD007978 MeSHD000871 MeSHD004364. MeSHD007978 blocked responses to MeSHD009538 of wild-type and alpha7x61 receptors. However, block was more dependent on MeSHD008564 for the alpha7x61 receptors. 5. We conclude that the MeSHD007930 insertion in transmembrane domain 2 has the unusual effect of slowing desensitization without altering apparent agonist affinity.
132	9713365	Promoter-specific MeSHD013002 2 MeSHD005796 imprinting in MeSHD006801 fetal MeSHD008099 and MeSHD018197.	MeSHD013002 2 (MeSHD007335) MeSHD005796 imprinting has been demonstrated to be promoter-specific, in that expression from the P1 promoter is biallelic whereas that from the MeSHC020845-P4 promoters is monoallelic. In the present study, in order to investigate MeSHD007335 MeSHD005796 imprinting status at the cellular level, allelic MeSHQ000032 was performed of MeSHD007335 MeSHD015870 transcribed from the P1 and P3 promoters, using MeSHD048348 MeSHD016133 (RT-MeSHD016133) on MeSHD006801 fetal MeSHD008099 and MeSHD018197. MeSHD017403 was also undertaken, to obtain information about the cellular localization of transcripts expressed from the P1 and P3 promoters. The results indicated that transcripts expressed from the P1 and P3 promoters co-localized in the same fetal or neoplastic MeSHD022781. These data should provide information regarding the molecular basis of MeSHD018392, suggesting that an imprint recognized for the differential expression may be strictly local and localized downstream of the MeSHD007335 P1 promoter.
133	9712537	MeSHD053764 Met146Leu variant due to an A --> T transversion in an early-onset familial MeSHD000544 MeSHD010375 from MeSHD001118.	Most of the cases of early-onset familial MeSHD000544 (MeSHD005182) are related to MeSHD020125 in the MeSHD053764 (PS-1) MeSHD005796 on MeSHD002883. Although PS-1 MeSHD009154 are distributed throughout the entire MeSHD016366, most MeSHD009154 are found in transmembrane region II and hydrophilic loop VI encoded by MeSHD005091 5 and 8, respectively. These two groups of substitutions are associated with an MeSHD017668 of 40-43 years for MeSHD005091 5 and 45-55 years for MeSHD005091 8, respectively. We have previously described a South American MeSHD010375 from MeSHD001118 with early-onset MeSHD005182 (mean MeSHD017668 38.9 +/- 3.9 years) with no MeSHD009154 in MeSHD005091 16 and 17 of the beta-MeSHD011506 precursor MeSHD005796 (betaPP770 transcript). Here we MeSHD058028 the identification of an A --> T transversion at the first position of MeSHD003062 146 of PS-1 in these MeSHD010361. This MeSHD020125 results in a Met --> Leu substitution, as reported for the Italian MeSHD010375 Tor1.1 and FAD4. The significant differences in MeSHD017668 and MeSHD003643 among members of MeSHD005191 II-III and IV suggest that other genetic and/or environmental factors may influence MeSHD004194 MeSHD010641 in this MeSHD010375.
134	9057837	MeSHD051381 MeSHD008099 MeSHD006056 contains a MeSHD011494 similar to the MeSHD047388 of lactating MeSHD042361.	By using a MeSHD002364-derived specific MeSHD010455 substrate for MeSHD042361 Golgi-enriched-fraction MeSHD047388, phosphorylating activity has been detected in the MeSHD006056 of MeSHD051381 MeSHD008099, MeSHD013154 and to a lesser extent, MeSHD007668 and MeSHD001921, while the other post-nuclear cytoplasmic fractions are totally devoid of such a MeSHD047388 activity. In contrast ubiquitous MeSHD047389 and CK2 (MeSHD047389 and 2), tested with their specific MeSHD010455 substrates, display different subcellular MeSHQ000600 and are almost undetectable in the Golgi fraction. The absence of CK2 in the Golgi fraction has been also confirmed using specific MeSHD000906. The relatedness between the MeSHD008099 MeSHD006056 MeSHD047388 (G-CK) and the bona fide MeSHD042361 Golgi-enriched-fraction MeSHD047388 (GEF-CK) is supported by a variety of MeSHD019370, notably: (a) identical MeSHD010455 MeSHD013379, consistent with an S-X-E-X MeSHD016384; (b) preference for Mn2+, and, to a lesser extent, Co2+, over Mg2+, as activating MeSHD002412; (c) superimposable elution profiles from MeSHC007369-MeSHD012685, MeSHC037405, and Superdex 200, this latter consistent with a molecular mass around 500 kDa; (d) insensitivity to MeSHD019311 and MeSHD006493 (a potent inhibitor of CK2) and inability to MeSHQ000706 MeSHD006160 as MeSHD010710 MeSHD014019 (by contrast to CK2). These data provide the evidence for the existence of a third class of ubiquitous MeSHD047388 here termed G-CK, distinct from CK1 and CK2, specifically located to the MeSHD006056 and related to the bona fide MeSHD047388(s) responsible for the MeSHD010766 of MeSHD002364 secreted from lactating MeSHD042361. The possible involvement of G-CK in the MeSHD010766 of MeSHD055571 MeSHD011506 at S-X-E motifs is discussed.
135	10953966	MeSHD020022 to childhood MeSHD054198.	"MeSHD054198 (ALL) is the most common pediatric MeSHD009369. The origin of this MeSHD004194 can be explained by a combination of MeSHD020022 factors and MeSHD004781. For the purpose of our study it can be considered as a complex MeSHD004194, caused by the ""carcinogenic"" effect of the MeSHD004777 modified by a series of MeSHD005796. In MeSHD011153, these MeSHD005796 tend to occur in allelic MeSHD020478 representing functional polymorphisms thus explaining inter-individual variability in MeSHD009369 susceptibility. The latter can be evaluated more realistically in MeSHD054198 than in sporadic MeSHD009369 of the MeSHD000328 because of its relatively short latency period. We asked therefore, the question about the MeSHD012380 of MeSHD005796 controlling the MeSHD004526 of MeSHD015262 MeSHQ000378 in childhood leukemogenesis. MeSHD015262 (MeSHD004364 and MeSHD002273) are excreted from the body after metabolic conversion by MeSHD004798 MeSHD017008 oxidation activation (Phase I) and conjugation detoxificaton (Phase II). Functional variants of these MeSHD004798, resulting from known MeSHD004247 polymorphisms in the corresponding MeSHD005796, were shown to influence the MeSHD012306 to a variety of solid tumours in MeSHD000328. A MeSHD016022 on ALL MeSHD010361 and healthy MeSHQ000517 in a French-Canadian MeSHD011153 was carried out by examining the loci of Phase I, MeSHD019363 and MeSHD019389, as well as Phase II MeSHD004798, GSTM1, GSTT1, NAT1 and NAT2. The NAT2 slow-acetylator, MeSHD019363*2A and GSTM1 null MeSHD005838 were shown to be significant MeSHD012306 determinants of ALL (OR=1.6, 1.8 and 1.8, respectively), whereas, polymorphisms in MeSHD019389 and GSTT1 MeSHD005796 did not seem to MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in the aetiology of ALL. Interestingly, the MeSHD012306 associated with NAT2 slow-acetylators was most apparent among MeSHD008297 homozygous for NAT1*4 (OR=3.3) whereas MeSHD014930 MeSHD017770 the MeSHD019363*4 MeSHD000483 were significantly underrepresented in the MeSHD010361 group (OR=0.2). These MeSHQ000175 point to a MeSHD005783-specific effect of MeSHD004247 variants which, at least in part, may explain why ALL is more prevalent among MeSHD008571. To assess MeSHD005796-MeSHD005796 interactions, NAT2 slow-acetylators were considered together with GSTM1 null MeSHD005838 and MeSHD019363*2A MeSHD000483. The combined presence of two MeSHD012306-elevating MeSHD005838 appeared to MeSHC020416 an increased MeSHD012306 of ALL among the carriers (OR=2.6). This MeSHD012306 was increased further (OR=3.3) when all three MeSHD005838 occurred in the same individuals indicating that the combination of susceptibility variants is more predictive of MeSHD012306 then either of them independently. The MeSHD001244 of leukemogenesis in MeSHD002648 with metabolising MeSHD005796 variants suggests causal relation to MeSHD004781."
136	10386412	MeSHD019194 improves preservation with MeSHD003080 MeSHQ000097 MeSHD006324 in valve replacement MeSHD010361.	The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that MeSHD019194 improves myocardial protection in valve replacement MeSHD010361 undergoing MeSHD003080-MeSHQ000097 cardioplegic arrest and to study the mechanisms of MeSHD006801 MeSHD019157 initially. Forty MeSHD010361 who required double valve replacement were studied. After the institution of MeSHD002315, 20 MeSHD010361 were preconditioned with two cycles of 3 min of aortic cross-MeSHD003250 and 2 min of MeSHD015424 before cardioplegic arrest (group IP). Twenty MeSHD010361 were not preconditioned as MeSHQ000517 (group C). All MeSHD006321 were arrested with 4 degrees C MeSHD003080-MeSHQ000097 MeSHD002314. During perioperation, the MeSHQ000097 samples were collected from MeSHD054326 and MeSHD017534, which were used to MeSHD014894 MeSHD015740 (CGRP) and MeSHD003402-MB (CK-MB). The right atrial myocardial MeSHD014024 was collected to MeSHD014894 MeSHD013482/MeSHD008315 (T-SOD/MDA) and to observe myocardial MeSHQ000648. MeSHD006439 date were measured. After MeSHD015424 for 30 min, myocardial MDA was significantly lower in group IP than in group C (2.6+/-0.2 vs. 3.8+/-0.3 nM/mg) and T-SOD was significantly higher in group IP than in group C (13.1+/-12.1 vs. 9.2+/-1.2 IU/mg). MeSHD019194 significantly increased the MeSHD004467 of myocardial CGRP just after preconditioning (92.0+/-4.1 vs. 52.3+/-4.5 pg/ml) and the begin of MeSHD015424 (95.3+/-3.8 vs. 61.2+/-4.9 pg/ml), and deduced the release of CK-MB at 12 h post-MeSHD015424 (77.5+/-9.2 vs. 136.5+/-8.9 IU/l). Preconditioning also improved cardiac MeSHQ000502 at 30 min and 12 h after MeSHD015424 (cardiac MeSHD020481 2.8+/-0.3 vs. 2.3+/-0.2 l/min per m2 and 2.9+/-0.1 vs. 2.4+/-0.2 l/min per m2). MeSHD019194 enhance cardioplegic protection in valve replacement MeSHD010361. The possible protective mechanism was that MeSHD019194 decreased the MeSHD004467 of MeSHD010100 MeSHD005609.
137	9753677	Wnt-4 is a mesenchymal signal for epithelial transformation of metanephric MeSHD008648 in the developing MeSHD007668.	MeSHQ000254 of the mammalian MeSHD007668 is initiated by ingrowth of the ureteric bud into the metanephric blastema. In response to signal(s) from the MeSHD014513, mesenchymal MeSHD002477 condense, aggregate into pretubular clusters, and undergo epithelialisation to MeSHD020478 simple epithelial tubules. Subsequent MeSHD009024 and differentiation of the tubular MeSHD004848 MeSHD007854 to the establishment of a functional MeSHD009399. Here we demonstrate that Wnt-4, a secreted MeSHD006023 which is required for tubule formation, is sufficient to trigger tubulogenesis in isolated metanephric MeSHD008648, whereas Wnt-11 which is expressed in the tip of the growing MeSHD014513 is not. Wnt-4 signaling depends on MeSHD002477 contact and sulphated MeSHD006025 and is only required for triggering tubulogenesis but not for later events. The Wnt-4 signal can be replaced by other members of the Wnt MeSHD005796 MeSHD005190 including Wnt-1, Wnt-3a, Wnt-7a and Wnt-7b. Further, dorsal MeSHD013116, which has been MeSHD013850 to mimic ureteric signaling in tubule induction induces Wnt-4 mutant as well as wild-type MeSHD008648 suggesting that MeSHD013116 derived signal(s) most likely act by mimicking the normal mesenchymal action of Wnt-4. These results lend additional support to the notion that Wnt-4 is a key auto-regulator of the mesenchymal to epithelial transformation that underpins nephrogenesis adding another level of complexity in the MeSHQ000145 of molecular events MeSHD017008 tubulogenesis.
138	9005444	Multimer formation as a consequence of separate homodimerization domains: the MeSHD006801 c-Jun MeSHD016350 is a transplantable MeSHD019281 module.	MeSHD006801 c-Jun and c-Fos MeSHD016350 domains were examined for their MeSHD001076 to serve as autonomous MeSHD019281 domains as part of a heterologous MeSHD011506 construct. MeSHD012549 MeSHD005982 (GST) was fused to recombinant Jun MeSHD016350 (rJunLZ) and Fos MeSHD016350 (rFosLZ) domains. MeSHD004591 'snapshot' analyses based on disulphide linkage of monomers demonstrated the MeSHD001076 of rJunLZ to MeSHQ000502 as a MeSHD019281 motif in a foreign MeSHD011506 MeSHD004777. Steric hindrance prevented formation of rJunLZ-GST::rFosLZ-GST heterodimers whereas rJunLZ-GST::rFosLZ and rJunLZ:: rFosLZGST formed readily. Furthermore, rJunLZGST generated homodimers suggesting fusion MeSHD011506 heterodimers interact differently to homodimers. MeSHD002850 confirmed that GST is a dimer in MeSHD012996 and that attachment of a MeSHD016350 domain allows further interactions to take place. Sedimentation equilibrium analyses showed that GST is a stable dimer (K(a) > 10(6) M(-1)) with no higher multimeric MeSHD020478. rFosLZ-GST weakly associates beyond a dimer (K(a) approximately 4 x 10(4) M(-1)) and rJunLZ-GST associates indefinitely (K(a) approximately 4 x 10(5) M(-1)) [corrected], consistent with an isodesmic model of MeSHD001244. The interaction of these MeSHD016350 independently of GST MeSHD001244 demonstrates their utility in the modification of MeSHD011506 when multimer formation is desired.
139	7551342	Correlation of p53 MeSHD011506 expression with apoptotic MeSHD015994 in colorectal MeSHD009369.	The wild-type MeSHD016158 suppresses MeSHD049109 and induces MeSHD017209 when it is transfected into MeSHD006801 MeSHD003110 MeSHD002460. Therefore, MeSHD009154 of the MeSHD016158, which correlates closely with p53 MeSHD011506 overexpression, would be predicted to activate MeSHD049109 and limit MeSHD017209. We tested this hypothesis by correlating p53 MeSHD011506 expression with MeSHD049109 and MeSHD017209 in 70 MeSHD009369 (29 MeSHD000236 and 41 MeSHD002277) using p53 and Ki-67 immunohistochemical MeSHD013194 and MeSHD053904 end labelling. The p53 immunoreactivity was independent of the Ki-67 positivity. The apoptotic MeSHD015994 was less frequent (P < 0.005) in tumours with diffuse p53 MeSHD011506 overexpression than in those with the sporadic overexpression, defined as p53 MeSHD013194 of isolated or scattered expression. In addition, apoptotic MeSHD015994 only correlated directly (P < 0.05) with Ki-67 positivity in tumours with sporadic p53-MeSHD011506 expression. These results indicate that p53 MeSHD011506 that is expressed sporadically in MeSHD015179 is probably wild-type MeSHD011506 and induces MeSHD017209 in response to active MeSHD049109. In contrast, diffusely overexpressed p53 MeSHD011506 in MeSHD015179 is probably mutant and correlates with a reduction in apoptotic MeSHD016923 independently of MeSHD049109.
140	10755396	MeSHD001290 towards prophylactic MeSHQ000601 and effects of genetic counselling in MeSHD005190 with BRCA MeSHD009154. Austrian Hereditary MeSHD001940 and MeSHD010051 Group.	The intent of this study was to evaluate the effect that an MeSHD001364 of being a BRCA1 or BRCA2 MeSHD009154 carrier has on the MeSHD001290 towards prophylactic MeSHQ000601 and on developing MeSHD003863 MeSHQ000175. Thirty-five MeSHD005190 were selected on the basis of previously detected BRCA1 or 2 MeSHD009154 and 90 MeSHD005190 were given the appropriate MeSHD011795. MeSHD000072036 (PM) was considered by 21% of the Austrian MeSHD009154 carriers (29% affected and 8% non-affected carriers). The majority of affected and non-affected carriers expected PM to impair the quality of their MeSHD019369. Fifty per cent would undergo prophylactic MeSHD010052 (53% affected and 46% non-affected carriers). The MeSHD004532-rating MeSHD003863 scale indicated that following MeSHD009154 result MeSHD030881 the MeSHD003863 scores of carriers decreased (40 baseline vs 38 after result MeSHD030881, P = 0.3), whereas, for non-carriers, scores increased (36 baseline vs 40 after result MeSHD030881, P = 0.05). We conclude that information about carrier status is not associated with increased MeSHD003863 MeSHQ000175 in MeSHD009154 carriers. In non-carriers, MeSHD003863 scores increased slightly, probably reflecting MeSHD017741 MeSHD006167. The option of having PM was associated with a negative impact on the MeSHD011788 and was declined by the majority of Austrian MeSHD009154 carriers.
141	9808485	Genotypic variation in the MeSHD053773 MeSHD005796: MeSHD001244 with MeSHD053773 MeSHD004467, fibrotic MeSHD008171, and MeSHD019737 MeSHD005355 after MeSHD016040.	MeSHD015291 (TGF)-beta1 is a profibrogenetic MeSHD016207 that has been implicated in the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD005355 in transplanted MeSHD014024. In this study, we have analyzed the genetic MeSHD012926 of MeSHD053773 MeSHD004467 in MeSHD008168 MeSHD066027. A MeSHD016133-MeSHD018807 technique was used to detect polymorphisms in the MeSHD053773 MeSHD005796 from genomic MeSHD004247. Polymorphisms were shown to correlate with MeSHD066298 MeSHD053773 MeSHD004467 by stimulated MeSHD008214. A single-specific MeSHD015345 hybridization MeSHD008722 was devised to screen for these polymorphisms in MeSHD008168 MeSHD019737 groups and MeSHQ000517. We have identified five polymorphisms in the MeSHD053773 MeSHD005796: two in the MeSHD011401 at positions -800 and -509, one at position +72 in a nontranslated region, and two in the MeSHD021382 at positions +869 and +915. The polymorphism at position +915 in the MeSHD021382, which changes MeSHD003062 25 (MeSHD001120-->MeSHD011392), is associated with interindividual variation in levels of MeSHD053773 MeSHD004467. Stimulated MeSHD008214 of homozygous MeSHD005838 (MeSHD001120/MeSHD001120) from MeSHQ000517 individuals produced significantly more MeSHD053773 MeSHD066298 (10037+/-745 pg/ml) compared with heterozygous (MeSHD001120/MeSHD011392) individuals (6729+/-883 pg/ml; P<0.02). In MeSHD010361 requiring MeSHD016040 for a fibrotic MeSHD008168 condition, there was an increase in the MeSHQ000453 of the high-producer MeSHD053773 MeSHD000483 (MeSHD001120). This MeSHD000483 was significantly associated with pretransplant fibrotic MeSHQ000473 (P<0.02) (n=45) when compared with MeSHQ000517 (n=107) and with pretransplant nonfibrotic MeSHQ000473 (P<0.004) (n=50). This MeSHD000483 was also associated with MeSHD064591 MeSHD005355 in transbronchial MeSHQ000473 when compared with MeSHQ000517 (P<0.03) and with nonallograft MeSHD005355 (P<0.01). The MeSHD004467 of MeSHD053773 is under genetic MeSHQ000517, and this in turn influences the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD008168 MeSHD005355. Hence, the MeSHD053773 MeSHD005838 has prognostic significance in MeSHD066027.
142	9622447	Alcohol decreases MeSHD013601 migration into MeSHD008168 MeSHD014024 in response to MeSHD045363 and depletes MeSHD013601 numbers in the MeSHD013154 of MeSHD051379.	Previous MeSHD014937 from our MeSHD007753 has shown that chronic MeSHD000428 in MeSHD051379 creates MeSHD007165 sufficient to MeSHD008004 MeSHD007239 with the opportunistic pathogen MeSHD045363. Host defense against P. carinii is critically dependent upon host MeSHD013601. In these experiments, we MeSHD019484 the effect of chronic MeSHD000428 on recruitment of MeSHD013601 into infected MeSHD008168 MeSHD014024 and on MeSHD008214 in host MeSHD008221. We find that MeSHD051379 administered alcohol in MeSHD060766 and then inoculated with P. carinii show significantly decreased recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ MeSHD013601 into MeSHD008168 MeSHD014024 in comparison with MeSHQ000517 MeSHD051379. Additional experiments show significant depletion of CD4+ MeSHD008214 in MeSHD013154 from alcohol MeSHD051379 and decreased numbers of activated MeSHD013601. MeSHQ000032 of surface expression of the adhesion molecules MeSHD016169, MeSHD039041, and MeSHD018799 show no significant differences in MeSHD008214 from alcohol-consuming MeSHD051379, and MeSHD008214 MeSHD002633 MeSHD066298 is also unaltered. We conclude that chronic MeSHD004467 of alcohol impairs MeSHD008168 recruitment of MeSHD008214 in response to an infectious challenge. This impaired MeSHD008214 recruitment may be a consequence of depletion of MeSHD013601 in host MeSHD008221. Impaired recruitment of MeSHD008214 may explain the increased MeSHD009017 and MeSHD009026 of pulmonary MeSHD007239 in MeSHD057229 subjects.
143	9793009	Psycho-social aspects of MeSHD001943 susceptibility testing: a MeSHD008091 MeSHD016454.	An important demand for MeSHD001943 susceptibility (BRCA) testing is anticipated not only in MeSHD014930 at high MeSHD012306 of MeSHD001943 but also in the general MeSHD011153. However, the benefits of this new MeSHD013672 may be substantially counterbalanced by the MeSHD012306 and limitations associated with it. BRCA testing offers the potential for early detection of MeSHD001943; however, it may MeSHD007854 to psycho-socially harmful consequences. Both carriers and non-carriers of a BRCA MeSHD009154 may MeSHD005145 tremendous emotional upheaval which may adversely impact on subsequent MeSHD001290 towards MeSHD003695. This MeSHD010209 points to the need for empirical studies examining the psycho-social aspects of BRCA testing. These studies should be undertaken cross-culturally in order to take into account the variations due to different MeSHD003695 and MeSHD003469 on psycho-social correlates of MeSHD009369 MeSHD005820.
144	11891309	The single-channel properties of MeSHD006801 MeSHD000109 alpha 7 receptors are altered by fusing alpha 7 to the MeSHD049452.	Neuronal nicotinic MeSHD000109 (AcCho) receptors composed of alpha7-subunits (alpha7-AcChoRs) are involved in many physiological activities. Nevertheless, very little is known about their single-channel characteristics. By using outside-out patch-clamp recordings from MeSHD014981 MeSHD009865 expressing wild-type (wt) alpha7-AcChoRs, we identified two classes of channel conductance: a low conductance (gamma(L)) of 72 pS and a high one (gamma(H)) of 87 pS, with mean open-MeSHD013995 (tau(op)) of 0.6 ms. The same classes of conductances, but longer tau(op) (3 ms), were seen in experiments with chimeric alpha7 receptors in which the wtalpha7 extracellular C terminus was fused to the MeSHD049452 (wtalpha7-GFP AcChoRs). In contrast, channels with three different conductances were gated by AcCho in MeSHD009865 expressing alpha7 receptors MeSHD017770 a Leu-to-Thr 248 MeSHD009154 (mutalpha7) or MeSHD009865 expressing chimeric mutalpha7-GFP receptors. These conductance levels were significantly smaller, and their mean open-MeSHD013995 were larger, than those of wtalpha7-AcChoRs. Interestingly, in the absence of AcCho, these MeSHD009865 showed single-channel openings of the same conductances, but shorter tau(op), than those activated by AcCho. Accordingly, MeSHD006801 homomeric wtalpha7 receptors open channels of high conductance and brief lifetime, and fusion to GFP lengthens their lifetime. In contrast, mutalpha7 receptors open channels of lower conductance and longer lifetime than those gated by wtalpha7-AcChoRs, and these parameters are not greatly altered by fusing the mutalpha7 to GFP. All this evidence shows that GFP-tagging can alter importantly receptor MeSHD007700, a fact that has to be taken into account whenever tagged MeSHD011506 are used to study their MeSHQ000502.
145	9530504	Mutant MeSHD005796 in familial MeSHD000544 and transgenic models.	The most common cause of MeSHD003704 occurring in mid- to late-MeSHD019369 is MeSHD000544 (AD). Some cases of AD, particularly those of early onset, are familial and inherited as autosomal dominant disorders linked to the presence of mutant MeSHD005796 that encode the MeSHD000682 precursor MeSHD011506 (APP) or the MeSHD053763 (PS1 or PS2). These mutant MeSHD005796 products cause MeSHQ000503/MeSHD003643 of MeSHD035862 of MeSHD009474 important in MeSHD008568, higher cognitive processes, and MeSHD001519. AD MeSHD000339 7-10% of individuals > 65 years of age and perhaps 40% of individuals > 80 years of age. For the late-onset cases, the principal MeSHD012307 are age and MeSHD001053 (MeSHD001057) MeSHD000483 type, with MeSHD053327 MeSHD000483 being a susceptibility factor. In this MeSHD016454, we briefly discuss the clinical MeSHD013577 of AD and the MeSHD009446/MeSHD000069338 of the MeSHD004194 and then focus MeSHD001288 on mutant MeSHD005796 linked to autosomal dominant familial AD (MeSHD005182), the MeSHD001695 of the MeSHD011506 encoded by these MeSHD005796, and the recent exciting progress in investigations of MeSHD030801 models that express these mutant MeSHD005796 and develop some features of AD.
146	10975831	Subset-specific MeSHD012926 of the lymphatic exit of recirculating MeSHD008214 in vivo.	The MeSHQ000097-to-MeSHD008196 recirculation of MeSHD008214 is required for the MeSHD008283 of immune MeSHQ000453 and the dissemination of MeSHD008568. Although the MeSHD001076 of MeSHD008196-borne MeSHD002477 to recirculate has been well documented, relatively less is known about the migration capacity of PBLs. We have found a clear preference for PBLs to recirculate through s.c. rather than intestinal MeSHD008198. This preference could be directly attributed to the migratory characteristics of MeSHD000075942. MeSHD000075942 were found to express significantly higher levels of MeSHD019041 than other subsets, suggesting that at least some of this preferential migration could be attributed to their interaction with MeSHD008024 on MeSHD004730. More detailed experiments showed that MeSHD000075942 migrated through MeSHD008198 with greater MeSHD004526 than alphabeta MeSHD013601 or B MeSHD002477, which clearly indicated an enhanced MeSHD001076 of MeSHD000075942 to exit MeSHD008198 in the efferent MeSHD008196 independent of entry from the MeSHQ000097. This hypothesis was supported by histological examination, where MeSHD000075942 were found almost exclusively in the interfollicular traffic areas within MeSHD008198. These data indicate that MeSHD000075942 are the most active recirculating MeSHD016131 in MeSHD012418 and suggest new mechanisms to regulate the traffic of MeSHD016131 through normal MeSHD008198.
147	12023811	Short-range interactions and size of MeSHD008024 bound to MeSHD004247 strongly influence adsorptive MeSHD044367 caused by long-range interactions.	Long-range interaction between all the MeSHD008024 bound to MeSHD004247 molecule may give rise to MeSHD000327 with the MeSHD002605 of MeSHD044367 of the first kind (D. Y. Lando, V. B. Teif, J. Biomol. Struct & Dynam. 18, 903-911 (2000)). In this case, the binding curve, c(c(o)), is characterized by a sudden change of the relative concentration of bound MeSHD008024 ((c)) at a critical concentration of free (unbound) MeSHD008024, c(o)=c(ocr), from a low c value to a high one where c(o) is MeSHD008963 concentration of free MeSHD008024. Such a transition might be caused by some types of MeSHD004247 condensation or changes in MeSHD004247 topology. For the study of the conditions necessary for MeSHD000327 with the MeSHD002605 of MeSHD044367, a calculation MeSHD008722 based on the MeSHD008722 of the free energy minimum is developed. The MeSHD008024 size and two types of interactions between MeSHD008024 adsorbed on MeSHD004247 molecule are taken into consideration: long-range interaction between all the MeSHD008024 bound to MeSHD004247 and contact interactions between neighboring MeSHD008024. It was found that a) Stronger long-range interaction is required for longer MeSHD008024 to induce MeSHD044367 that is occurred at greater c(ocr) values; b) Pure contact interaction between neighboring MeSHD008024 can not itself initiate MeSHD044367. However contact cooperativity strongly decreases the threshold value of energy of long-range interaction necessary to give rise to the transition.
148	9811875	Inactivating MeSHD009154 in an MeSHD018909-encoding MeSHD005796 in MeSHD008232.	MeSHD008232 (XLP) is an inherited immunodeficiency characterized by increased susceptibility to MeSHD004854 (MeSHD004854). In affected MeSHD008297, primary MeSHD020031 MeSHD007854 to the uncontrolled proliferation of MeSHD014780-containing B MeSHD002477 and reactive cytotoxic MeSHD013601, often culminating in the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD008228. The XLP MeSHD005796 has been mapped to MeSHD002875 band Xq25 through linkage MeSHQ000032 and the discovery of MeSHD010361 harboring large constitutional genomic deletions. We describe here the presence of small deletions and intragenic MeSHD009154 that specifically disrupt a MeSHD005796 named DSHP in 6 of 10 unrelated MeSHD010361 with XLP. This MeSHD005796 encodes a predicted MeSHD011506 of 128 MeSHD000596 composing a single MeSHD018909 with extensive homology to the MeSHD018909 of SHIP, an MeSHD000072181 that MeSHQ000502 as a negative regulator of MeSHD008213. DSHP is expressed in transformed MeSHD013601 lines and is induced following MeSHD066298 activation of peripheral MeSHQ000097 MeSHD013601. Expression of DSHP is restricted in vivo to MeSHD008221, and MeSHD012313 MeSHD017403 demonstrates DSHP expression in activated T and B MeSHD002477 regions of reactive MeSHD008198 and in both T and B MeSHD002477 MeSHD009369. These MeSHD019370 confirm the identity of DSHP as the MeSHD005796 responsible for XLP, and suggest a MeSHD012380 in the MeSHD012926 of MeSHD008213 and proliferation. Induction of DSHP may sustain the MeSHD007109 by interfering with SHIP-mediated inhibition of MeSHD008213, while its inactivation in XLP MeSHD010361 results in a selective immunodeficiency to MeSHD004854.
149	11275982	Establishment of MeSHD051381 MeSHD006528 MeSHD002460 with differing MeSHQ000556 potential in MeSHD008819.	For better MeSHD032882 of MeSHD009369 MeSHD009362, we have established an in vivo model for induction of highly MeSHQ000556 MeSHD006528 (HCC) in MeSHD008297 MeSHD011916. From 1 MeSHD009369, 4 MeSHD002460 with differing MeSHQ000556 potential (C1, C2, C6, C5F) were established by subcloning using the limited-dilution MeSHD019976 technique. Two other lines, N1 and L2, arose from another primary HCC and a MeSHD008168 MeSHQ000556 lesion, respectively. Although MeSHD002448 of each MeSHD002460 in MeSHQ000208 medium was different, MeSHD009369 developing in the subcutis of MeSHD008819 after MeSHQ000637 were all moderately differentiated HCC with a trabecular pattern. On MeSHD007279 into MeSHD008819, all 6 MeSHD002460 proved to be tumorigenic in the MeSHD007267 site and C5F was highly MeSHQ000556 to the MeSHD008168. With MeSHD007267 into the MeSHD013623 MeSHD014680, N1 and L2 formed frequent MeSHD009362 in the MeSHD008168 as well as in MeSHD008198. Using MeSHD007274, C1, C6, N1 and L2 showed marked disseminated MeSHQ000254 in the MeSHD034841 with bloody ascitis. MeSHD015152 MeSHQ000032 revealed expression of known MeSHD009362-related MeSHD005796, KAI1 and MeSHC038253, to be decreased in C5F, but no differences in expression of nm23-H1 were evident. A MeSHD017354 in the MeSHD000071679 MeSHD010766 site of the MeSHD051176 MeSHD005796 was found in L2. These transplantable HCC MeSHD002460 that have different MeSHQ000556 MeSHD001076 should be useful for elucidation of mechanisms of MeSHD009362.
