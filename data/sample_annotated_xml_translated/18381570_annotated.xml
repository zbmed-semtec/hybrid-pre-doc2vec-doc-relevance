title: BRAFV600E MeSHD009154 is associated with preferential MeSHD012680 to MeSHD020929 inhibition in MeSHD013964 MeSHD002460.
abstract: CONTEXT: Mutually exclusive MeSHD009154 of RET, RAS, or BRAF are present in about 70% of MeSHD000077273, whereas only the latter two are seen in poorly differentiated and anaplastic MeSHD009369. Although the signal output common to these MeSHD015513 is ERK, a recent MeSHD058028 showed that only BRAF MeSHD009154 consistently predicted responsiveness to MeSHD020929 (MeSHD020929) MeSHQ000037. OBJECTIVES: Here we investigated whether MeSHD012680 to MeSHD020929 inhibition was determined by MeSHD009857 status in 13 MeSHD006801 MeSHD013964 MeSHD002460: four with BRAF MeSHD009154, four RAS, one RET/PTC1, and four wild type. RESULTS: MeSHQ000254 of BRAF (+) MeSHD002477 was inhibited by the MeSHD020929 antagonist MeSHC506614 with an IC(50) of less than 5 nm. By contrast, RAS, RET/PTC1, or wild-type MeSHD002477 had IC(50) of 4 nm to greater than 1000 nm. MeSHD012680 was not predicted by coexisting MeSHD009154 in PIK3CA or by PTEN status. Similar effects were obtained with the MeSHD020929 inhibitor MeSHC517975. MeSHC506614 induced a sustained G1/S arrest in BRAF (+) but not BRAF (-) lines. MeSHC506614 was equipotent at inhibiting pERK1/2 after 2 h, regardless of MeSHD000068617, but pERK rebounded at 24 h in most lines. MeSHD020929 inhibitor resistance was associated with partial refractoriness of pERK to further inhibition by the compounds. MeSHC517975 was more potent at inhibiting MeSHQ000254 of NPA (BRAF +) than Cal62 (KRAS +) MeSHD064593. CONCLUSION: MeSHD013964 with BRAF MeSHD009154 are preferentially sensitive to MeSHD020929 MeSHQ000037, whereas MeSHD009369 with other MeSHD020929-ERK effector pathway MeSHD005796 MeSHD009154 have variable responses, either because they are only partially dependent on ERK and/or because MeSHD005246 responses elicit partial refractoriness to MeSHD020929 inhibition.
