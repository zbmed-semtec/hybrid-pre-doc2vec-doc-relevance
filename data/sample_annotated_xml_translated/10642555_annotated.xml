Although ubiquitinated MeSHD006657 are present in substantial levels in MeSHD014714 MeSHD002477, the MeSHD012380 they MeSHD010988 in specific MeSHD001686 and the cellular factors that regulate this modification are not well characterized. Ubiquitinated H2B (uH2B) has been identified in the MeSHD015003 MeSHD012441, and MeSHD009154 of the conserved MeSHD054875 site is shown to MeSHC020416 MeSHQ000002 in mitotic MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000254 and MeSHD008540. uH2B was not detected in rad6 mutants, which are defective for the MeSHD044763 Ubc2, thus identifying Rad6 as the major cellular activity that ubiquitinates H2B in MeSHD015003.
