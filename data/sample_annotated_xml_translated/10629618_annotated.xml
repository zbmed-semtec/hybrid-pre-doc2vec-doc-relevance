title: MeSHD006360 associated with MeSHD004260 MeSHD004798 in MeSHD006367.
abstract: Two MeSHD004798 of MeSHD004260 (BER), MeSHD051981 (UDG) and MeSHD019951 (beta pol), from MeSHD006367 co-eluted from MeSHC049225 FPLC columns. The UDG was completely displaced from 150-180-kDa fractions to 30- 70-kDa fractions by MeSHD003419 with 0.5 N NaCl, MeSHD006863 3.0, as expected when MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 MeSHD001244 are disrupted, but beta pol was not displaced by this MeSHQ000628. UDG was not essential to the presence of beta pol in the 150-180-kDa MeSHD004798 complex. beta pol and UDG apparently reside in separate but co-eluting structures. Immunoaffinity MeSHD002845 showed that the MeSHD001244 of UDG and beta pol was accounted for by attachment in common to MeSHD004247 and that the MeSHD001244 was abolished by eliminating MeSHD004247. Evidence for base excision repairosomes containing UDG and beta pol in MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 assemblies was not found. However, UDG and MeSHD006801 MeSHD043603 (HAP1) were associated with HSP70 and HSP27, which are present in 150-180-kDa and 30-70-kDa MeSHD011506 of MeSHD002477 sonicates. The MeSHD001244 of HSPs with BER MeSHD004798 was confirmed by MeSHD017665 MeSHD011506-MeSHD023302 and immunoaffinity tests. The MeSHD001244 of HSPs and BER MeSHD004798 is a novel finding. HSP binding may account for the presence of BER MeSHD004798 in the two large size class fractions and HSPs may have functional MeSHD012380 in BER.
