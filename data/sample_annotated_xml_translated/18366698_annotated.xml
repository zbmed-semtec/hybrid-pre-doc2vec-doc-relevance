title: The MeSHQ000706 of biomedicine, complementary and MeSHD000529, and MeSHD008519 for the MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD004827 among people of South MeSHD044466 origin in the UK.
abstract: BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that a significant proportion of people with MeSHD004827 MeSHQ000706 complementary and MeSHD000529 (CAM). CAM MeSHQ000706 is known to vary between different MeSHD005006 and cultural contexts; however, little MeSHD001288 has been devoted to inter-ethnic differences within the UK MeSHD011153. We studied the MeSHQ000706 of biomedicine, complementary and MeSHD000529, and MeSHD008519 in a sample of people with MeSHD004827 of South MeSHD044466 origin living in the north of MeSHD004739. METHODS: MeSHD017203 were conducted with 30 people of South MeSHD044466 origin and 16 MeSHD017028 drawn from a sampling frame of MeSHD010361 over 18 years old with MeSHD004827, compiled from MeSHD004827 MeSHD016435 and MeSHD006761 MeSHD019991. All MeSHD017203 were tape-recorded, translated if required and transcribed. A framework approach was adopted to analyse the data. RESULTS: All those interviewed were taking conventional anti-epileptic MeSHD004364. Most had also sought help from traditional South MeSHD044466 practitioners, but only two people had tried conventional CAM. Decisions to consult a traditional healer were taken by MeSHD005190 rather than by individuals with MeSHD004827. Those who made the decision to consult a traditional healer were usually older MeSHD005190 and their MeSHD009042 and MeSHD010465 of MeSHD012449 and efficacy often differed from those of the recipients of the MeSHQ000628. No-one had discussed the MeSHQ000706 of traditional MeSHQ000628 with their doctor. The patterns observed in the UK mirrored those reported among people with MeSHD004827 in MeSHD007194 and MeSHD010154. CONCLUSION: The MeSHD003695-seeking behaviour of study participants, although mainly confined within the MeSHD008519 sector, shared much in common with that of people who MeSHQ000706 global CAM. The appeal of traditional MeSHQ000628 lay in their religious and moral MeSHD007086 within the South MeSHD044466 MeSHD012111, especially to the older generation who were disproportionately influential in the MeSHQ000032 of MeSHQ000628 choices. As a second generation made up of people of Pakistani origin born in the UK reach the age when they are the influential decision makers in their MeSHD005190, resort to traditional MeSHQ000628 may decline. People had long experience of navigating plural systems of MeSHD003695 and avoided potential conflict by maintaining strict MeSHD004243 between different sectors. MeSHD003695 practitioners need to approach these issues with MeSHD012680 and to regard traditional healers as potential allies, rather than competitors or quacks.
