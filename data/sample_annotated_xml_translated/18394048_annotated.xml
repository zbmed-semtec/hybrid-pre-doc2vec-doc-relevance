title: Effect of MeSHD000077287 on MeSHD000071080: a MeSHD050781 study.
abstract: BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: We studied the effect of MeSHD000077287 (LEV), an MeSHD000927 with a novel MeSHQ000494, on MeSHD000071080, measured using MeSHD050781 (TMS). For this purpose, 38 MeSHD064368 were assessed in two TMS sessions, before and after an oral dose of 3000 mg LEV. METHODS: Resting motor threshold (RMT), intracortical facilitation (ICF) and intracortical inhibition (ICI), cortical silent period (CSP) threshold and duration and MeSHD019054 (MEP) amplitude were calculated. RESULTS: MeSHD000359 with LEV, RMT was increased (mean +/- SD: 63 +/- 14% of the maximum stimulator output) compared with baseline (58 +/- 11%). CSP threshold was decreased after LEV (54 +/- 10%; baseline, 57 +/- 11%). CSP duration was increased after LEV (116 +/- 37 ms; baseline: 102 +/- 33 ms). LEV did not MeSHD000339 ICF or ICI or mean MEP amplitude significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that LEV modulates some aspects of MeSHD000071080. Whereas the increase in the RMT most probably reflects the effect of LEV on MeSHD007473 activity, effects on the CSP might represent a modulation of MeSHD018079 at cortical and spinal level.
