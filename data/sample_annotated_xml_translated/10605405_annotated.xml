title: Ki-67, oestrogen receptor, and MeSHD011980 MeSHD011506 in the MeSHD006801 rete ovarii and in MeSHD004715.
abstract: AIM: To examine proliferative activity using the Ki-67 MeSHD011506, oestrogen receptor MeSHD011506, and MeSHD011980 MeSHD011506 expression in the rete ovarii, and to make comparisons with their expression in MeSHD004715. METHODS: MeSHD007150 was used to study the rete ovarii in 24 cases and MeSHD004715 in seven cases, using MeSHD000906 to Ki-67 MeSHD011506 (MeSHQ000254 fraction (GF) quantified using a point score MeSHD008722) and oestrogen receptor and MeSHD011980 (quantified using the H score MeSHD008722). RESULTS: There was no evidence of a significant difference in the Ki-67 MeSHD011506, oestrogen receptor, and MeSHD011980 in the rete ovarii in different phases of the MeSHD008597 (proliferative phase: GF = 1.052, oestrogen receptor H score = 13.4, MeSHD011980 H score = 15.32; secretory phase: GF = 0.736, oestrogen receptor H score = 7.5, MeSHD011980 H score = 1.84). The expression of all three MeSHD011506 was greater in the foci of MeSHD004715 (GF = 6.99, oestrogen receptor H score = 152.02, MeSHD011980 H score = 127.36) than in the rete ovarii (p < 0.0005-0.0008, MeSHD018709). CONCLUSIONS: There is a low rate of MeSHD049109 in the rete ovarii and this structure shows less responsiveness to MeSHD006728 stimulation than foci of MeSHD004715. These differences may provide a useful tool to distinguish the rete ovarii from MeSHD004715 in cases of diagnostic difficulty.
