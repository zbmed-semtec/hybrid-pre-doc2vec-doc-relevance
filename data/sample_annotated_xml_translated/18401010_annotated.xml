title: MeSHD006224 MeSHD013075: MeSHD012380 of MeSHD019289 MeSHD010088 A and MeSHD008058.
abstract: Recently, we demonstrated that MeSHD019289 MeSHD010088 A2 (PDHA2) is MeSHD014443 phosphorylated in capacitated MeSHD006224 MeSHD013094. In this MeSHD058028, using MeSHC017092 (BP), an inhibitor of PDHA, we demonstrated that MeSHD006224 MeSHD013094 hyperactivation was blocked regardless of whether PDHA was inhibited prior to or after the onset of hyperactivation, but the MeSHD020101 was blocked only if PDHA was inhibited prior to the onset of the MeSHD020101. Further, inhibition of PDHA activity did not inhibit capacitation-associated MeSHD011506 MeSHD014443 MeSHD010766 observed in MeSHD006224 MeSHD013094. It is demonstrated that the essentiality of PDHA for MeSHD013075 is probably dependent on its MeSHD001076 to generate effectors of capacitation such as MeSHD017382 (ROS) and cAMP, which are significantly decreased in the presence of BP. MICA (MeSHC008400, a specific inhibitor of MeSHD008058 [DLD]), another component of the MeSHD011768 (PDHc), also significantly inhibited ROS generation and cAMP levels thus implying that these MeSHD004798 of the PDHc are required for ROS and cAMP generation. Furthermore, dibutryl cyclic MeSHD000249 could significantly reverse the inhibition of hyperactivation observed in the presence of BP and inhibition of MeSHD020101 observed in the presence of BP or MICA. The MeSHD061207, MeSHD000001, could also significantly reverse the inhibitory effect of BP and MICA on MeSHD013094 MeSHD020101. These results establish that PDHA is required for MeSHD006224 MeSHD013094 hyperactivation and MeSHD020101, and DLD is required for MeSHD006224 MeSHD020101. This study also provides evidence that ROS, cAMP, and MeSHD002118 are involved downstream to PDHA.
