title: A MeSHD016678-wide MeSHD046228 reveals anti-inflammatory target MeSHD005796 of MeSHC013638 in MeSHD008264.
abstract: OBJECTIVE: Paeony root has long been used for its anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, the effects of MeSHC014959, MeSHC015423, and MeSHC013638, compounds from paeony root, on MeSHD059467 were examined in MeSHD008264 challenged with the MeSHD007249 inducer MeSHD008070 (LPS). METHODS: The RAW264.7 MeSHD008264 were treated with LPS in the presence or absence of MeSHC014959, MeSHC015423, or MeSHC013638. Global MeSHD012333 expression levels were detected by using an MeSHD020411 platform covering the MeSHD051379 whole MeSHD016678. RESULTS: MeSHQ000628 with LPS caused expression level changes in 1,270 MeSHD005796 by 2 folds or more. MeSHC013638 attenuated the induction level of 355 LPS-responsive MeSHD005796. MeSHD002965 of the MeSHD005796 targeted by MeSHC013638 according to the Panther group MeSHQ000032 revealed 20 MeSHD001686, 24 molecular MeSHQ000502, and 22 signaling pathways. The Panther signaling pathways highly affected by MeSHC013638 included the 'MeSHD007249 mediated by MeSHD018925 and MeSHD016207 signaling', 'MeSHD007378 signaling', and 'Toll receptor signaling'. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that MeSHC013638 has extensive inhibitory effects on the MeSHD012926 of MeSHD007249 associated MeSHD015870 by LPS in MeSHD008264. In addition, the predominant effect of MeSHC013638 among the tested compounds suggests that MeSHC013638 may be a major ingredient for the anti-inflammatory effect of paeony root.
