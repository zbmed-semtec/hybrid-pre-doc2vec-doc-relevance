title: MeSHD001853 trephine MeSHQ000033 and immunohistochemical MeSHQ000175 in chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia.
abstract: Chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (CMML) is a clonal disorder with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative features. Its MeSHD003933 is based on the presence of peripheral MeSHQ000097 monocytosis and MeSHD001853 aspirate MeSHQ000175, according to MeSHD014944 MeSHQ000592. However, MeSHD001853 trephine MeSHQ000473 (BMTB) features characteristic of CMML have not been adequately investigated. We studied BMTB in 20 cases of CMML-1 and three cases of CMML-2 and compared with ten cases of polycythaemia vera, ten cases of chronic myeloid leukaemia (chronic phase) and ten cases of florid myeloid MeSHD006965 (MH). Furthermore, we evaluated the MeSHQ000706 of CD34, CD117 and CD68 (PGM-1) MeSHD000906 in MeSHD003933 and subtyping of CMML and in differentiating from other categories. Hypercellularity, high myeloid:erythroid ratio, increased proportion of 'myelo/monocytic' MeSHD002477 often seen as clusters and/or nodules, absence of MeSHD004802, and presence of abnormal localisation of immature precursors (ALIP) and dysmegakaryopoiesis can aid in the MeSHD003933 of CMML in BMTB. CD68 (PGM-1) positive MeSHD002477 amounted to 20.7 +/- 6.1% MeSHD002477 among CMML trephines. The proportion of CD34(+) MeSHD002477 among cases of CMML-1 was =5% and among CMML-2 was >/=10% MeSHD002477 in two of three cases and 5% in the other case. Morphological and immunohistochemical features of BMTB samples are extremely helpful in the MeSHD003933 of CMML.
