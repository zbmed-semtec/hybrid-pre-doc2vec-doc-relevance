title: A MeSHD002678 MeSHD000069550-based MeSHD008722 for classifying the MeSHD003480 with comorbid adrenocortical lesions.
abstract: BACKGROUND: The MeSHD011379 for many MeSHD009369 could be improved dramatically if they could be detected while still at the microscopic MeSHD004194 stage. It follows from a comprehensive statistical MeSHQ000032 that a number of MeSHD000941 such as hTERT, MeSHD018809 and Ki-67 can be considered as MeSHD009369 markers, while another set of MeSHD000941 such as P27KIP1 and FHIT are possible markers for normal MeSHD014024. Because more than one marker must be considered to obtain a MeSHD002965 of MeSHD009369 or no MeSHD009369, and if MeSHD009369, to classify it as malignant, borderline, or benign, we must develop an intelligent decision system that can fullfill such an unmet medical need. RESULTS: We have developed an intelligent decision system using MeSHD000069550 MeSHQ000379 and markers to characterize MeSHD014024 as cancerous, non-cancerous or borderline. The system incorporates MeSHD007858 MeSHQ000379 such as variants of MeSHD060388, neural networks, MeSHD003663, MeSHD004532-organizing feature MeSHD019532 (SOFM) and recursive maximum contrast MeSHD014197 (RMCT). These variants and MeSHD000465 we have developed, tend to detect microscopic pathological changes based on features derived from MeSHD015870 levels and MeSHD055442. We have also used MeSHD007150 MeSHQ000379 to MeSHD014894 the MeSHD059467 from a number of MeSHD000941 such as MeSHD019927, P27KIP1, FHIT, Ki-67, MeSHD018809, Bax, Bcl-2, P53, Fas, FasL and hTERT in several particular types of MeSHD018358 such as MeSHD010673, MeSHD010235, and the MeSHD018268 (ACC), MeSHD000236 (ACA), and MeSHD006965 (ACH) involved with MeSHD003480. We provided statistical evidence that higher expression levels of hTERT, MeSHD018809 and Ki-67 etc. are associated with a higher MeSHD012306 that the MeSHD009369 are malignant or borderline as opposed to benign. We also investigated whether higher expression levels of P27KIP1 and FHIT, etc., are associated with a decreased MeSHD012306 of adrenomedullary MeSHD009369. While no significant difference was found between MeSHD002477-arrest MeSHD000941 such as P27KIP1 for malignant, borderline, and benign MeSHD009369, there was a significant difference between expression levels of such MeSHD000941 in normal MeSHD000313 samples and in adrenomedullary MeSHD009369. CONCLUSIONS: Our frame MeSHD014937 focused on not only different MeSHD002965 schemes and feature selection MeSHD000465, but also ensemble MeSHQ000379 such as boosting and bagging in an effort to improve upon the accuracy of the individual classifiers. It is evident that when all sorts of MeSHD000069550 and statistically MeSHD007858 MeSHQ000379 are combined appropriately into one integrated intelligent medical decision system, the prediction MeSHD011209 can be enhanced significantly. This MeSHD012106 has many potential applications; it might provide an alternative diagnostic tool and a better MeSHD032882 of the mechanisms involved in malignant transformation as well as information that is useful for MeSHQ000628 planning and MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000517.
