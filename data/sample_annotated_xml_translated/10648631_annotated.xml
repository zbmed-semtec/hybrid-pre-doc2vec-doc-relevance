title: Mutational MeSHQ000032 of the highly conserved MeSHD001120 within the Glu/MeSHD017819-Arg-Tyr motif of the alpha(1b)-MeSHD011941: effects on receptor isomerization and activation.
abstract: We have suggested previously that both the negatively and positively charged residues of the highly conserved Glu/MeSHD017819-Arg-Tyr (E/DRY) motif MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in the activation process of the alpha(1b)-adreneric receptor (AR). In this study, R143 of the E/DRY sequence in the alpha(1b)-AR was mutated into several MeSHD000596 (Lys, His, Glu, MeSHD017819, Ala, Asn, and Ile). The MeSHD005249-conserving MeSHD009154 of R143 into MeSHD008239 not only preserved the maximal agonist-induced response of the alpha(1b)-AR, but it also conferred high degree of constitutive activity to the receptor. Both basal and agonist-induced MeSHD010766 levels were significantly increased for the R143K mutant compared with those of the wild-type receptor. Other substitutions of R143 resulted in receptor mutants with either a small increase in constitutive activity (R143H and R143D), impairment (R143H, R143D), or complete loss of receptor-mediated response (R143E, R143A, R143N, R143I). The R413E mutant displayed a small, but significant increase in basal MeSHD010766 despite being severely impaired in receptor-mediated response. Interestingly, all the MeSHD001120 mutants displayed increased affinity for agonist binding compared with the wild-type alpha(1b)-AR. A correlation was found between the extent of the affinity shift and the intrinsic activity of the MeSHQ000819. The MeSHQ000032 of the receptor mutants using the allosteric ternary complex model in conjunction with the results of MeSHD056004 on the receptor models support the hypothesis that MeSHD009154 of R143 can MeSHD004328 the isomerization of the alpha(1b)-AR into different states, highlighting the crucial MeSHD012380 of this residue in the activation process of the receptor.
