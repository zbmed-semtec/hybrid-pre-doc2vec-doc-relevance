The MeSHD001053 E (APOE) MeSHD011110 has been studied in MeSHD010300 (PD) with conflicting results. Recently, a newly described functional polymorphism in the MeSHD012045 of the APOE MeSHD005796, (-491 A/T), has been associated with late-onset MeSHD000544. We studied the MeSHD001244 between these two polymorphisms of the APOE MeSHD005796 with PD in a sample of 126 PD MeSHD010361 and in 119 MeSHQ000517 from the same geographic background. Allelic and genotypic MeSHQ000453 were not different between PD cases and MeSHD011155 for either the APOE or -491 A/T polymorphism. The MeSHD017668 of the MeSHD004194 was not different according to the specific MeSHD005838 of the two polymorphisms of the APOE MeSHD005796.
