20441857	An empirical MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD000072480 vehicle crash MeSHD014947 severities on MeSHD007484's public road system.	MeSHD000072480 vehicle crashes are a major MeSHD012449 concern for MeSHD000067565 as well as all other users of the public road system in agricultural states. Using data on MeSHD000072480 vehicle crashes that occurred on MeSHD007484's public roads between 2004 and 2006, we estimate a multinomial MeSHD016015 to identify crash-, MeSHD000072480 vehicle-, and driver-specific factors that determine MeSHD000072480 vehicle crash MeSHD014947 severity outcomes. Estimation MeSHQ000175 indicate that there are crash patterns (rear-end manner of collision; single-vehicle crash; MeSHD000072480 vehicle crossed the centerline or median) and conditions (obstructed MeSHD014785 and crash in rural area; dry road, dark MeSHD008029, speed limit 55 mph or higher, and harvesting MeSHD012621), as well as MeSHD000072480 vehicle and driver-contributing characteristics (old MeSHD000072480 vehicle, young MeSHD000072480 vehicle driver), where targeted intervention can help reduce the severity of crash outcomes. Determining these contributing factors and their effect is the first step to identifying countermeasures and MeSHD012449 strategies in a bid to improve MeSHD014186 MeSHD012449 for all users on the public road system in MeSHD007484 as well as other agricultural states.
19240225	Meta- and pooled MeSHQ000032 of GSTP1 polymorphism and MeSHD008175: a HuGE-GSEC MeSHD016454.	MeSHD008175 is the most common MeSHD009369 worldwide. Polymorphisms in MeSHD005796 associated with MeSHD002273 MeSHQ000378 may modulate MeSHD012306 of MeSHD004194. MeSHD051549 (GSTP1) detoxifies MeSHD011084 found in MeSHD062789 MeSHD012906 and is the most highly expressed MeSHD005982 in MeSHD008168 MeSHD014024. A polymorphism in the GSTP1 MeSHD005796, an A-to-G transition in MeSHD005091 5 (Ile105Val, 313A --> 313G), results in lower activity among individuals who carry the MeSHD014633 MeSHD000483. The authors present a meta- and a pooled MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD016022 that examined the MeSHD001244 between this polymorphism in GSTP1 and MeSHD008175 MeSHD012306 (27 studies, 8,322 cases and 8,844 MeSHQ000517 and 15 studies, 4,282 cases and 5,032 MeSHQ000517, respectively). MeSHD016424, the MeSHD017418 found no significant MeSHD001244 between MeSHD008175 MeSHD012306 and the GSTP1 MeSHD005091 5 polymorphism. In the pooled MeSHQ000032, there was an MeSHD016424 MeSHD001244 (MeSHD016017 = 1.11, 95% MeSHD016001: 1.03, 1.21) between MeSHD008175 and carriage of the GSTP1 Val/Val or Ile/Val MeSHD005838 compared with those MeSHD017770 the Ile/Ile MeSHD005838. Increased MeSHD012306 varied by histologic type in MeSHD044466. There appears to be evidence for interaction between amount of MeSHD012907, the GSTP1 MeSHD005091 5 polymorphism, and MeSHD012306 of MeSHD008175 in MeSHD044465.
23553297	A novel patellofemoral scoring system for MeSHD057071 status.	We were not aware of a well-validated MeSHD057071-specific scoring system. We performed this study to develop and validate a scoring system (Samsung Medical Center [SMC] patellofemoral scoring system) suitable for the evaluation of MeSHD057071 status. We recruited 179 individuals consisting of a study group of 123 MeSHD010361 with anterior MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146 but without MeSHD010146 in another part of the MeSHD007717, twenty-eight MeSHD010361 with MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146 other than anterior MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146 (group A), and twenty-eight MeSHD064368 without MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146 (group B). Items in the MeSHQ000254 of the scoring system that showed a significant difference between the study group and group A and between the study group and the group B were selected. MeSHD015203 was measured by intraclass correlation coefficient, internal consistency was measured by the Cronbach alpha, content validity was assessed by ceiling and MeSHD005430 effects, and construct validity was determined by the MeSHD001244 of the Feller scores and the SMC patellofemoral scores. After the item verification process, seventeen items (eight items for MeSHD046788 and nine items for patellofemoral MeSHQ000502) were selected. MeSHD015203 for MeSHD016424 SMC patellofemoral scores showed excellent reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient, 0.85), and internal consistency was excellent (Cronbach alpha, 0.97). MeSHD005430 and ceiling effects were acceptable (<30%) for all the items of the SMC patellofemoral scoring system, except one: MeSHD000077708 down on a chair, in the patellofemoral MeSHQ000502 score. The SMC patellofemoral scores showed moderate correlation with the Feller scores (ρ = -0.45). The SMC patellofemoral score is a novel scoring system that distinguishes MeSHD010361 with anterior MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146 or patellofemoral MeSHQ000503 from MeSHD010361 with MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146 or MeSHQ000503 arising from other MeSHD007717 problems, and from those without MeSHD007717 MeSHD010146. The MeSHD015203 of the SMC patellofemoral scoring system were verified in the present study.
26380768	MeSHD016449 of induction MeSHQ000628 and MeSHQ000601 versus combined MeSHD004358 and MeSHQ000532 in stages IIIA-N2 NSCLC: a MeSHD000078182 and MeSHD017418.	The efficacy of induction MeSHQ000628 plus MeSHQ000601 for improving postoperative MeSHD013534 in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD002289 (NSCLC) in stages IIIA-N2 is controversial, especially compared with the combined MeSHD004358 and MeSHQ000532. We therefore performed a MeSHD000078182 and MeSHD017418 of the published phase III randomized MeSHD016430 (RCTs) to quantitatively evaluate the MeSHD013534 benefit of preoperative induction MeSHQ000628 vs. combined MeSHD059248. We systematically searched for trials that started after January, 1980. We excluded relevant studies using the Preferred Reporting Items for MeSHD000078182 and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) MeSHD012015. Our primary endpoint, MeSHD016424 MeSHD013534 (OS), was defined as the MeSHD013995 from randomisation until MeSHD003643 (any cause). MeSHQ000556 endpoint was MeSHD000077982 (PFS). MeSHD039781, EMBASE and Cochrane MeSHD007990 were used for the study search. All analyses were by MeSHD033182 to treat. Three studies (1,084 MeSHD010361) were centrally selected and analyzed for the present MeSHD017418. Combination of the three MeSHD016449 showed that there was no significant benefit of induction MeSHQ000628 plus MeSHQ000601 compared to combined MeSHD059248 on 2-year OS [MeSHD016017 (RR) =1.00; 95% CI, 0.85-1.17; P=0.98] and 4-year OS (RR =1.13; 95% CI, 0.85-1.51; P=0.39). However, from the subgroup MeSHQ000032, it showed a significant PFS benefit (RR =1.78; 95% CI, 1.08-2.92; P=0.02) regarded MeSHD059248 as preoperative induction MeSHQ000628, compared with MeSHD004358 alone for induction MeSHQ000628 (PFS) (RR =1.05; 95% CI, 0.61-1.81; P=0.86). There was no significant OS benefit of induction MeSHQ000628 plus MeSHQ000601 compared with combined MeSHD059248 in MeSHD010361 with NSCLC (stages IIIA-pN2) at 2 and 4 years. However, we could conclude PFS could be improved when MeSHQ000532 was added into preoperative induction MeSHQ000628. Given the potential advantages of adding MeSHD011827 preoperatively, clinicians should consider using this MeSHQ000628 strategy in the stage IIIA-N2 MeSHD004194 after fully assessment of the MeSHD010361.
19695851	MeSHD000428 and MeSHD000082742 in older lifelong MeSHD014920 drinkers: the Italian MeSHD008137 on MeSHD000375.	A protective effect of moderate MeSHD000428 on the MeSHD002319 has consistently been reported, but limited evidence has been produced on the MeSHD001244 of alcohol with metabolic factors in the MeSHD000368. The aim of this study was to investigate the MeSHD001244 between different levels of current MeSHD000428 and MeSHD000082742 in a representative sample of MeSHD000368 Italian MeSHD008571, mainly MeSHD014920 drinkers. This is a cross-sectional multi-centre study on a MeSHD011153-based sample of Italian MeSHD008571 MeSHD000368 65-84 years, drawn from the Italian MeSHD008137 on MeSHD000375 (ILSA) cohort. The analyses included 1896 MeSHD008571. Almost all the drinkers (98%) drank MeSHD014920 as a lifelong MeSHD006184. Adjusted ORs for MeSHD012306 levels for cardiovascular factors (BMI, MeSHD055105, MeSHD005340, α2 MeSHD011506, MeSHD007962, MeSHD008076, MeSHD016632, total MeSHD002784, MeSHD001055-I, MeSHD014280, LDL, MeSHD006442, MeSHD007328, MeSHD005215 MeSHD010949 MeSHD005947, HOMA IR, systolic and diastolic MeSHD001794) were estimated, comparing drinkers with teetotalers using multivariate MeSHD016015 models. We found MeSHD000428 in older age associated with healthier hematological values of MeSHD005340, MeSHD008076, MeSHD016632 MeSHD008074 and MeSHD007328, but it was also associated with a worse hematological picture of total, MeSHD008078 levels, and MeSHD001794. Our results indicated in MeSHD000368 moderate MeSHD014920 drinkers a noticeably safe metabolic, inflammatory and glycemic profile that might balance higher MeSHD001794, leading to a net benefit. These MeSHQ000175 however need to be placed in relation to the known adverse social and MeSHD006262 effects of heavy MeSHD004326.
20368174	Common MeSHQ000002 of ABCG2, a high-capacity MeSHD014527 exporter, cause MeSHD006073: a MeSHQ000502-based genetic MeSHQ000032 in a MeSHD044466 MeSHD011153.	MeSHD006073 based on MeSHD033461 is a common MeSHD004194 with a MeSHD020022, which MeSHQ000209 acute MeSHD001168. The ABCG2/BCRP MeSHD005796, located in a MeSHD006073-susceptibility locus on MeSHD002875 4q, has been identified by recent MeSHD055106 of MeSHD044967 MeSHD014527 concentrations and MeSHD006073. MeSHD014527 transport assays demonstrated that ABCG2 is a high-capacity MeSHD014527 MeSHQ000378 transporter. Sequencing of the ABCG2 MeSHD005796 in 90 MeSHD033461 MeSHD010361 revealed several nonfunctional ABCG2 MeSHD009154, including Q126X. MeSHD040641 MeSHQ000032 of 739 individuals showed that a common dysfunctional variant of ABCG2, Q141K, increases MeSHD044967 MeSHD014527. Q126X is assigned to the different MeSHD004194 MeSHD006239 from Q141K and increases MeSHD006073 MeSHD012306, conferring an MeSHD016017 of 5.97. Furthermore, 10% of MeSHD006073 MeSHD010361 (16 out of 159 cases) had MeSHD005838 combinations resulting in more than 75% reduction of ABCG2 MeSHQ000502 (MeSHD016017, 25.8). Our MeSHQ000175 indicate that nonfunctional variants of ABCG2 essentially block gut and renal MeSHD014527 excretion and cause MeSHD006073.
28439700	MeSHD000069585-alone versus pegylated MeSHD000069585-alone for autologous MeSHD000072916 mobilization in newly diagnosed MeSHD009101 MeSHD010361.	Autologous MeSHD018380 (aHSCT) is the recommended standard upfront MeSHQ000628 for MeSHD019737 eligible myeloma MeSHD010361. Considering possible MeSHQ000150 related to MeSHD004358-MeSHD016207 mobilization, MeSHD016207-alone mobilization is often used. We compared mobilization with MeSHD000069585 alone to MeSHC455861 alone in newly diagnosed myeloma MeSHD010361 after induction MeSHQ000628 with MeSHD000069286 and MeSHD003907. The comparison was made between MeSHD000072916 (PBSC) yields, number of MeSHD001781, MeSHD006412 subsets, and MeSHD013995 to MeSHD009504 and MeSHD001792 engraftment after aHSCT. A total of 42 myeloma MeSHD010361 were prospectively enrolled in the study: 21 received MeSHD000069585, 21 MeSHC455861. MeSHD005434 was used to determine the number of PBSC, myeloid, lymphoid, and MeSHD008533 precursors in peripheral MeSHQ000097 and MeSHD001781 product on day 1 of MeSHD001781. The median number of collected PBSC was 5.05 × 106/kg in the MeSHD000069585 and 4.66 × 106/kg in the MeSHC455861 group (p = 0.428). The median number of MeSHD001781 was 2.5 in the MeSHD000069585 and 2 in the MeSHC455861 group (p = 0.901). The number of MeSHD008533 precursors in peripheral MeSHQ000097 was significantly higher in the MeSHD000069585 group, but not in the MeSHD001781 products. There were no statistically significant differences in the myeloid and lymphoid precursors in the peripheral MeSHQ000097 and in the MeSHD001781 products. The median MeSHD013995 to MeSHD009504 and MeSHD001792 engraftment was 13 days and 16.5 days for MeSHD000069585 and 13 days and 16 days for MeSHC455861 group. We can conclude that MeSHC455861 alone is at least equally successful as MeSHD000069585 alone for the PBSC mobilization in newly diagnosed myeloma MeSHD010361.
21846115	Deciphering the protective MeSHD012380 of MeSHD009569 against MeSHD000077323 at the physiological and proteomic levels in MeSHD003313.	Saline stress is a major factor that limits crop yield. MeSHD009569 (NO) is functional during MeSHD010944 MeSHQ000254, MeSHQ000254, and defense responses. In the present study, the protective MeSHD012380 of NO in alleviating saline stress in MeSHD003313 at the physiological and proteomic levels was examined. Our results showed that MeSHD012492 MeSHQ000628 quickly induced NO accumulation and addition of the NO MeSHD014019 MeSHD026423 (SNAP) efficiently eliminated the inhibitory effect of MeSHD012492 on shoot MeSHQ000254 and MeSHD010788 and inhibited MeSHD012492-inducible H2O2 accumulation. These effects could be reversed by NO metabolic scavengers and MeSHQ000037. Further proteomic and MeSHD015153 MeSHQ000032 revealed that NO induced MeSHD019204-associated MeSHD011506 accumulation and MeSHD000975 MeSHQ000201, in addition to activation of defense MeSHD011506, MeSHD004734, and MeSHQ000166/division in MeSHD012492-treated MeSHD003313 MeSHD036226. Controlling the MeSHD019204 status with MeSHD019204 activators or MeSHQ000037 also affected NO generation and root and stem MeSHQ000254 in MeSHD003313 MeSHD036226 after saline stress. On the basis of these results, we propose that NO enhances MeSHD055049 in MeSHD003313 MeSHD036226 by enhancing MeSHD000975 MeSHQ000201 and controlling H2O2 levels, and these effects are accompanied by diverse downstream defense responses. During this process, MeSHD019204 signaling is an early event that MeSHD014937 upstream of NO biogenesis.
27162091	MeSHD044466 herb MeSHD008511 against MeSHC120542 catalyzed transformations, a key MeSHD012380 in MeSHD016908 progress.	Many MeSHD006094 can anchor their MeSHD008565 to the MeSHD002473 MeSHD010457 covalently by a common mechanism with MeSHC120542 (SrtA), thus escaping from the host's identification of immune MeSHD002477. SrtA can complete this anchoring process by cleaving LPXTG motif conserved among these MeSHD008565 and thus these MeSHD011506 anchor on the MeSHD002473. Moreover, those SrtA mutants lose this capability to anchor these relative MeSHD011506, with these MeSHQ000382 no longer infectious. Therefore, SrtA MeSHQ000037 can be promising MeSHD000890 to cure MeSHD001424. MeSHD044466 herb MeSHD008511 (CHMs) (chosen from MeSHD012586 Citation MeSHD020481) have exhibited inhibition on SrtA of Gram-positive pathogens irreversibly or reversibly. In general, CHMs are likely to have important long-term impact as new MeSHD000900 and sought after by academia and the MeSHD004345. This MeSHD016454 mainly focuses on SrtA MeSHQ000037 from CHMs and the potential inhibiting mechanism related to MeSHQ000737 of compounds in CHMs.
21837702	Endoscopic transoral oropharyngectomy using laparoscopic MeSHD013525.	Recently, several transoral approaches for MeSHD019060 have been developed for MeSHD009959. However, all approaches have certain disadvantages. Therefore, we built and examined new surgical MeSHD004777 for improving the situation. Endoscopic transoral resection using a pharyngeal retractor or distending MeSHD020704, rigid videoendoscope, and laparoscopic MeSHD013525 was performed in 17 MeSHD010361 with MeSHD000077195. Postoperative results regarding oncology and MeSHQ000502 as well as MeSHQ000150 were documented. The 2-year MeSHD012008-free MeSHD015996 was 100%. Postoperative MeSHD003679 and MeSHD013060 MeSHQ000502 were satisfactory: 94.1% of cases scored ≤1 on the functional outcome MeSHD003679 scale (FOSS) and ≤1 on the MeSHD003142 score. Further, no perioperative MeSHD009026 occurred. The improved surgical MeSHD004777 made it possible to perform a safe and reliable en bloc resection with a wide field of view and sufficient working space. Our system can be useful, although further studies on additional cases are required.
29797481	Refining area of occupancy to MeSHD019484 the modifiable areal unit problem in MeSHD004463 and conservation.	The modifiable areal unit problem is prevalent across many aspects of MeSHD062206 within MeSHD004463 and conservation. The problem is particularly manifested when calculating MeSHD008795 for extinction MeSHD012306 estimation, for example, area of occupancy (AOO). Although embedded in the International Union for the Conservation of MeSHD019368 (IUCN) Red List MeSHQ000592, AOO is often not used or is poorly applied. We evaluated new and existing MeSHQ000379 for calculating AOO from MeSHQ000453 MeSHD011996 and devised a MeSHD008722 for determining the minimum AOO with a MeSHD003020 grid. We evaluated the MeSHD000071038 shape, origin, and MeSHD012399 with real-world and simulated data and reviewed the effects on AOO values and possible impacts for species already assessed on the IUCN Red List. The AOO varied by up to 80%, and a ratio of MeSHD002477 to points of 1:1.21 yielded the maximum variation in the number of occupied MeSHD002477. These MeSHQ000175 potentially impact 3% of existing species on the IUCN Red List and species not yet assessed. Our new MeSHD008722 combined grid MeSHD012399 and moving grid origin and gave fast, robust, and reproducible results and, in the majority of cases, achieved the minimum AOO. As well as determining minimum AOO, our MeSHD008722 yielded a MeSHD016001 that should be incorporated into existing tools that support species MeSHD018570. We recommend when recording AOO and other areal measurements that the MeSHQ000379; summary MeSHD020500 across multiple iterations; angle and origin of the minimum grid; MeSHD019532 MeSHD011385; and datum be recorded, this MeSHD014836 MeSHD007854 to more robust species MeSHD018570.
25476443	MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD039904 Using Functional MeSHD006801 MeSHD005109.	The MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD000818 products in the derivation and MeSHD008283 of MeSHD006801 MeSHD039904 (hPSCs) limits their possible applications in MeSHD012106 and in clinics. Thus, one of the major MeSHD006040 in MeSHD044968 is the establishment of MeSHD000818-free conditions to support the MeSHQ000208 and differentiation of MeSHD006801 MeSHD013234. MeSHD006801 MeSHD005347 produce an MeSHD005109 (ECM) which can be extracted without the MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD003902, sterilized, and then used to coat MeSHD014024 MeSHQ000208 plates. We have shown that MeSHD000066449 (MeSHD000066449) grown on this matrix maintain their pluripotency in the presence of medium conditioned by MeSHD005347 MeSHD002477, and that these MeSHD002477 maintain expression of MeSHD008565 (MeSHC066584, Tra1-60, Tra1-81), MeSHD000469 activity, and specific intracellular markers (Nanog, Oct-4, Tert, FoxD3) in MeSHD000066449. This MeSHQ000254 system reduces exposure of hPSCs to MeSHD061252 and MeSHD000818 ingredients, thereby limiting the MeSHD012306 of pathogenic contamination and additionally, facilitating their manipulation. Herein we present an improved version of our previous protocol for extracting ECM from MeSHD006801 MeSHD052816 MeSHD005347 using a different MeSHD002021. Our new MeSHD009997 MeSHD008722 is MeSHD003902-free, reduces MeSHD003365, and preserves the integrity of the extracted ECM. This improved protocol has been validated for undifferentiated-state hPSC MeSHD008283 (more than 40 passages), MeSHD013234 differentiation, and for MeSHD054443.
21194483	Smed454 MeSHD064886: unravelling the MeSHD059467 of Schmidtea MeSHD000086222.	MeSHD005618 MeSHD010932 are an attractive model for MeSHD012038 and MeSHD057905 and have become a promising tool in the field of MeSHD044968. With the availability of a sequenced MeSHD010932 MeSHD016678, the recent application of modern genetic and high-throughput tools has resulted in revitalized interest in these MeSHD000818, long known for their amazing regenerative capabilities, which enable them to regrow even a new MeSHD006257 after MeSHD049248. However, a detailed description of the MeSHD010932 MeSHD059467 is essential for MeSHD005544 investigation into regenerative processes using MeSHD010932 as a model system. In order to MeSHD003165 and improve existing MeSHD058977, we used a 454 MeSHD059014 approach to analyze the MeSHD059467 of the MeSHD010932 species Schmidtea MeSHD000086222 Altogether, 598,435 454-sequencing reads, with an average length of 327 bp, were assembled together with the ~10,000 sequences of the S. MeSHD000086222 UniGene set using different similarity cutoffs. The assembly was then mapped onto the current MeSHD016678 data. Remarkably, our Smed454 MeSHD064886 contains more than 3 million novel transcribed MeSHD009711 sequenced for the first MeSHD013995. A descriptive MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD010932 splice sites was conducted on those Smed454 contigs that mapped univocally to the current MeSHD016678 assembly. MeSHD017421 allowed us to identify MeSHD005796 encoding putative MeSHD011506 with defined structural properties, such as transmembrane domains. Moreover, we annotated the Smed454 MeSHD064886 using MeSHD063990, and identified putative homologues of several MeSHD005796 MeSHD005190 that may MeSHD010988 a key MeSHD012380 during MeSHD012038, such as MeSHD018377 and MeSHD006728 receptors, MeSHD005801-containing MeSHD005796, and MeSHD005796 related to MeSHD005123 MeSHQ000502. We MeSHD058028 the first MeSHD010932 transcript MeSHD064886, Smed454, as an open MeSHD006295 tool that can be accessed via a web interface. Smed454 contains significant novel sequence information about most expressed MeSHD005796 of S. MeSHD000086222. MeSHQ000032 of the annotated data promises to contribute to identification of MeSHD005796 MeSHD005190 poorly characterized at a functional level. The Smed454 MeSHD059467 data MeSHD014836 assist in the molecular characterization of S. MeSHD000086222 as a model organism, which MeSHD014836 be useful to a broad scientific MeSHD012111.
29214975	Home-based MeSHD006293 for older people with mild MeSHD000073496: the HomeHealth intervention MeSHQ000254 and feasibility RCT.	Mild MeSHD000073496 or pre-MeSHD000073496 is common and yet is potentially reversible. Preventing progression to worsening MeSHD000073496 may benefit individuals and lower MeSHD006262/MeSHD012944 MeSHD003365. However, we know little about effective approaches to preventing MeSHD000073496 progression. (1) To develop an evidence- and theory-based home-based MeSHD006293 intervention for older people with mild MeSHD000073496. (2) To assess feasibility, MeSHD003365 and acceptability of (i) the intervention and (ii) a full-scale MeSHD016896 and MeSHD003362 randomised controlled trial (RCT). Evidence MeSHD016454, qualitative studies, intervention MeSHQ000254 and a feasibility RCT with process evaluation. INTERVENTION DEVELOPMENT: Two MeSHD000078182 (including systematic searches of 14 MeSHD019991 and MeSHD012042, 1990-2016 and 1980-2014), a MeSHD012196 (from inception to 2015) and MeSHD057766 MeSHD016454 identified effective components for our intervention. We collected data on MeSHD006292 and potential intervention components from semistructured MeSHD017203 and MeSHD017144 with older people (MeSHD000368 65-94 years) (n = 44), MeSHD017028 (n = 12) and MeSHD006262/MeSHD012944 professionals (n = 27). These data, and our evidence MeSHD016454, fed into MeSHQ000254 of the 'HomeHealth' intervention in collaboration with older people and multidisciplinary stakeholders. 'HomeHealth' comprised 3-6 sessions with a support MeSHD009274 trained in behaviour change MeSHQ000379, MeSHD003142 skills, MeSHD015444, nutrition and MeSHD000339. Participants addressed MeSHD004532-directed independence and well-being MeSHD006040, supported through MeSHQ000193, skills MeSHQ000193, enabling individuals to overcome barriers, providing MeSHD005246, maximising MeSHD009042 and promoting MeSHD006184 formation. FEASIBILITY RCT: Single-blind RCT, individually randomised to 'HomeHealth' or MeSHQ000628 as usual (TAU). MeSHD012111 settings in MeSHD008131 and Hertfordshire, UK. A total of 51 MeSHD057187 MeSHD000328 MeSHD000368 ≥ 65 years with mild MeSHD000073496. Feasibility - recruitment, retention, acceptability and intervention MeSHD003365. Clinical and MeSHD004472 outcome data at 6 months included functioning, MeSHD000073496 status, well-being, MeSHD000079225, MeSHD011788, capability and NHS and societal service utilisation/MeSHD003365. We successfully recruited to target, with good 6-month retention (94%). Trial MeSHQ000379 were acceptable with minimal missing data. Individual randomisation was feasible. The intervention was acceptable, with good fidelity and modest delivery MeSHD003365 (£307 per MeSHD010361). A total of 96% of participants identified at least one MeSHD006040, which were mostly MeSHD015444 related (73%). We found significantly better functioning (Barthel MeSHD020481 +1.68; p = 0.004), better MeSHD018737 (+6.48 kg; p = 0.02), reduced MeSHD000079225 (12-item General MeSHD006262 MeSHD011795 -3.92; p = 0.01) and increased capability-MeSHD019057 [+0.017; 95% MeSHD016001 (CI) 0.001 to 0.031] at 6 months in the intervention MeSHD001132 than the TAU MeSHD001132, with no differences in other outcomes. NHS and MeSHD017028 support MeSHD003365 were variable but, MeSHD016424, were lower in the intervention MeSHD001132 than the TAU MeSHD001132. The main limitation was difficulty maintaining outcome assessor blinding. Evidence is lacking to inform MeSHD000073496 MeSHQ000517 service design, with no large-scale trials of multidomain interventions. From stakeholder/public perspectives, new MeSHD000073496 MeSHQ000517 services should be personalised and encompass multiple domains, particularly socialising and mobility, and can be delivered by trained non-MeSHD013038. Our multicomponent MeSHD006293 intervention was acceptable and delivered at modest MeSHD003365. Our small study shows promise for improving clinical outcomes, including functioning and independence. A full-scale individually RCT is feasible. FUTURE WORK: A large, definitive RCT of the HomeHealth service is warranted. This study is registered as PROSPERO CRD42014010370 and Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN11986672.

24975878	Elevated p53 promotes the processing of miR-18a to decrease MeSHD011960-α in MeSHD005260 MeSHD006528.	The MeSHD004967 pathway has long been implicated as a MeSHD009369 protector in MeSHD005260 MeSHD006515 (HBV)-related MeSHD006528 (HCC). Our previous study identified that MeSHD047628 (ERα) MeSHD011506 is downregulated in 60% of MeSHD005260 HCC cases, via a miR-18a elevation mediated suppression of ERα translation. This study aims to delineate the mechanism underlying the MeSHD015854 of miR-18a in MeSHD005260 HCC. The MeSHQ000032 of 77 MeSHD005260 HCC specimens revealed that miR-18a levels were associated with pre-miR-18a rather than pri-miR-18a levels, suggesting an enhanced processing of pri- to pre-miR-18a. Among a panel of factors involved in MeSHD035683 processing, p53 was identified as a novel regulator for miR-18a maturation process. Knockdown of p53 by si-MeSHD012313 decreased the level of miR-18a, whereas overexpression of either wild-type or mutant p53 increased its level. The MeSHD001244 between the elevation of miR-18a and the accumulation of p53, mainly caused by somatic MeSHD009154, was confirmed in the clinical specimens of HBV-related MeSHD005260 HCC. By analyzing the MeSHD001244 with clinicopathological features, activation of this p53/miR-18a pathway mainly occurs in younger or noncirrhosis MeSHD005260 HCC MeSHD010361 and associated with a trend of worse MeSHD016424 MeSHD013534. Therefore, this study demonstrated a novel MeSHQ000502 of elevated/mutant p53 in regulating the amount of ERα MeSHD011506 through its promoting the biogenesis of miR-18a, which could MeSHD007854 to decrease the MeSHD009369-protective MeSHQ000502 of the MeSHD004967 pathway in MeSHD005260 hepatocarcinogenesis.
28415969	MeSHD015780 resistance, inappropriate empiric MeSHQ000628 and outcomes among MeSHD010361 hospitalized with MeSHD004755 MeSHD014552, MeSHD011014 and MeSHD018805.	MeSHD004351 among gram-negative pathogens is a MeSHD012307 for inappropriate empiric MeSHQ000628 (IET), which in turn increases the MeSHD012306 for MeSHD009026. We explored the impact of MeSHD000073182 (CRE) on the MeSHD012306 of IET and of IET on outcomes in MeSHD010361 with MeSHD004756. We conducted a retrospective MeSHD015331 in Premier Perspective MeSHD019991 (2009-2013) of 175 US MeSHD006761. We included all MeSHD000328 MeSHD010361 with MeSHD012111-onset MeSHQ000208-positive MeSHD014552 (UTI), MeSHD011014, or MeSHD018805 as a principal MeSHD003933, or as a MeSHQ000556 MeSHD003933 in the setting of MeSHD012131, treated with MeSHD000900 within 2 days of admission. We employed regression modeling to compute adjusted MeSHD001244 of presence of CRE with MeSHD012306 of receiving IET, and of IET on MeSHD017052, MeSHD007902 (LOS) and MeSHD003365. Among 40,137 MeSHD010361 presenting to the MeSHD006761 with an MeSHD004755 UTI, MeSHD011014 or MeSHD018805, 1227 (3.1%) were CRE. In both groups, the majority of the cases were UTI (51.4% CRE and 54.3% non-CRE). Those with CRE were younger (66.6+/-15.3 vs. 69.1+/-15.9 years, p < 0.001), and more likely to be MeSHD001741 (19.7% vs. 14.0%, p < 0.001) than those with non-CRE. Both chronic (Charlson score 2.0+/-2.0 vs. 1.9+/-2.1, p = 0.009) and acute (by day 2: ICU 56.3% vs. 30.4%, p < 0.001, and MeSHD012121 35.8% vs. 11.7%, p < 0.001) MeSHD017281 were higher among CRE than non-CRE subjects, respectively. CRE MeSHD010361 were 3× more likely to receive IET than non-CRE (46.5% vs. 11.8%, p < 0.001). In a regression model CRE was a strong predictor of receiving IET (adjusted MeSHD012306 ratio 3.95, 95% MeSHD016001 3.5 to 4.5, p < 0.001). In turn, IET was associated with an adjusted rise in MeSHD009026 of 12% (95% MeSHD016001 3% to 23%), and an excess of 5.2 days (95% MeSHD016001 4.8, 5.6, p < 0.001) LOS and $10,312 (95% MeSHD016001 $9497, $11,126, p < 0.001) in MeSHD003365. In this large US MeSHD019991, the MeSHQ000453 of CRE among MeSHD010361 with MeSHD004755 UTI, MeSHD011014 or MeSHD018805 was comparable to other national estimates. MeSHD007239 with CRE was associated with a four-fold increased MeSHD012306 of receiving IET, which in turn increased MeSHD009026, LOS and MeSHD003365.
24024879	MeSHD002415, MeSHD004285 and MeSHD039981 MeSHD000485 levels on MeSHD002648's soft MeSHD010988.	MeSHD002648's soft MeSHD010988 are known to harbour MeSHD039981 (HDM) MeSHD000485, but little is known whether they harbour MeSHD002415 or MeSHD004285 MeSHD000485. The objective of the study was to MeSHD014894 MeSHD002415 (Fel d 1), MeSHD004285 (Can f 1) and HDM MeSHD000485 on MeSHD002648's soft MeSHD010988. MeSHD004391 was collected from 40 MeSHD002648's soft MeSHD010988 and their MeSHD001513. Data were collected on MeSHD057805 MeSHD010067. MeSHD004391 samples were analysed for Fel d 1, Can f 1, MeSHC451162 and MeSHC451159 by MeSHD004797 (MeSHD004797) and results are expressed as median levels with inter-quartile ranges. Thirty-five (87.5%) soft MeSHD010988 had detectable Fel d 1 levels (median: 0.73 µg/g; inter-quartile range: 0.26-2.56 µg/g) while 34 (85%) had detectable Can f 1 levels (1.20 µg/g; 0.53-2.68). Correspondingly, 32 (80%) MeSHD001513 had detectable Fel d 1 levels (0.18 µg/g, 0.07-1.01) while 34 (85%) had detectable Can f 1 levels (0.50 µg/g; 0.33-1.06). All MeSHD001513 and soft MeSHD010988 had detectable HDM MeSHD000485 (MeSHC451162 + MeSHC451159) levels with soft MeSHD010988 containing about three MeSHD013995 higher levels than MeSHD001513. In homes with MeSHD002415 (n = 10) Fel d 1 levels were higher on soft MeSHD010988 than homes without MeSHD002415 (2.49 versus 0.48 µg/g; p = 0.0009). In homes with MeSHD004285 (n = 25) Can f 1 levels were generally higher on soft MeSHD010988 (1.38 versus 0.63 µg/g; p = 0.10). This study has shown that soft MeSHD010988 can harbour MeSHD002415 and MeSHD004285 MeSHD000485 as well as HDM MeSHD000485, some with very high levels. MeSHD002415 and MeSHD004285 MeSHD010067 resulted in higher Fel d 1 and Can f 1 levels on soft MeSHD010988 and MeSHD001513. The levels of Fel d 1, Can f 1 and HDM MeSHD000485 on soft MeSHD010988 could be of importance to sensitized asthmatic MeSHD002648.
19404829	Adapting MeSHD013058-based platforms for clinical MeSHD040901 applications: The MeSHD019075 coupled MeSHD013058 paradigm.	Single MeSHD015415 detection is common in MeSHD000090464 due to the currently available MeSHD008722 spectrum. For various MeSHD004194, however, no specific single MeSHD015415 could be identified. A strategy to overcome this diagnostic void is to shift from single analyte detection to multiplexed MeSHD015415 profiling. Mass spectrometric MeSHQ000379 were employed for MeSHD015415 discovery in MeSHD001826. The enormous complexity of biofluidic MeSHD020543 compartments implies upstream fractionation. For this reason, MeSHD013058 (MS) was coupled to MeSHD015180, MeSHD002853, surface-enhanced MeSHD007834 desorption/ionization, or MeSHD019075 (CE). Differences in performance and operating characteristics make them differentially suited for routine MeSHD007753 applications. Progress in the field of clinical MeSHD040901 relies not only on the MeSHQ000706 of an adequate technological platform, but also on a fast and efficient proteomic MeSHD057188 including standardized sample preparation, proteomic data processing, statistical validation of MeSHD015415 selection, and sample MeSHD002965. Based on CE-MS MeSHQ000032, we describe how proteomic MeSHD013672 can be implemented in a MeSHD000090464 MeSHD004777. In the last part of this MeSHD016454, we give an overview of CE-MS-based MeSHD000068397 and present information on identity and MeSHD001688 significance of the identified MeSHD010455 MeSHD015415 providing evidence of MeSHD004194-induced changes in proteolytic processing and MeSHD011499.
23286647	MeSHD060845 behaviour in an Italian non-clinical sample.	MeSHD060845 is associated with significant impairment. Although traditionally considered as a symptom of MeSHD009771 (OCD), some authors have proposed that pathological MeSHD060845 could be considered as a stand alone condition. The MeSHQ000453 of pathological MeSHD060845 behaviour has been shown to be high in some countries, but little is known about the MeSHQ000453 and correlates of MeSHD060845 in the non-clinical MeSHD011153 in MeSHD007558. We studied the MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD004532-reported MeSHD060845 behaviour using the Italian version of the Saving MeSHD004864-Revised, as well as the MeSHD001244 between MeSHD060845 and various clinical correlates, including obsessive-compulsive MeSHQ000175, compulsive buying, MeSHD001007, and MeSHD003863. The MeSHQ000453 of pathological MeSHD060845 behaviour in two studies was between 3.7 and 6.0%. No differences were found between MeSHD060845 and non-MeSHD060845 participants with regard to MeSHD005783, age, MeSHD017533, level of MeSHQ000193, and MeSHD004651. Significant correlations were found between compulsive MeSHD060845 and obsessive-compulsive MeSHQ000175 and also between MeSHD060845 and a MeSHD014894 of compulsive buying, even after controlling for MeSHD001007 and MeSHD003863. These results indicate that pathological MeSHD060845 may also be prevalent in MeSHD007558 and highlight the need for further MeSHD016021 using validated MeSHQ000295 to assess MeSHD000067836.
21623990	First evidence of genetic MeSHD001244 between the MIF-173G/C MeSHD020641 and MeSHD011085.	The purpose of this study was to investigate whether polymorphism of MIF MeSHD005796 is associated with PCOS. METHOD OF STUDY: The MIF-173G/C MeSHD020641 (SNP) was detected in 529 PCOS MeSHD010361 and 585 healthy MeSHD005260 MeSHQ000517 of MeSHD044466 Han ancestry. The MeSHD001244 of the MeSHD005796 variants with clinical and metabolic parameters and MeSHD006728 levels was investigated. The MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD005838 and allelotypes of the MIF-173G/C SNP did significantly differ between MeSHD014930 with PCOS and healthy MeSHQ000517 (P = 0.017 and P = 0.003, respectively). They did significantly differ between obese PCOS MeSHD010361 and obese MeSHQ000517 (P = 0.029 and P = 0.039, respectively). The MIF-173 CC and CG MeSHD005838 were associated with higher MeSHD015992 (BMI) and MeSHD049629 (WHR) in both PCOS MeSHD010361 (P < 0.001, P = 0.001) and normal MeSHQ000517 (P < 0.001, P = 0.002). The PCOS MeSHD010361 with CC and CG MeSHD005838 had higher MeSHD005215 MeSHD010949 MeSHD005947 levels (P < 0.001), higher MeSHD005215 MeSHD007328 levels (P < 0.001), and higher HOMA-IR (P < 0.001) compared with MeSHD010361 with the GG MeSHD005838. The MIF-173G/C polymorphism is associated with PCOS in MeSHD044466 Han MeSHD014930 and may contribute to the phenotypic expression of PCOS.
22215133	Live-MeSHD002477 imaging of migrating MeSHD002477 expressing fluorescently-tagged MeSHD011506 in a three-dimensional matrix.	Traditionally, MeSHD002465 has been studied on two-dimensional, stiff MeSHD010969 surfaces. However, during important MeSHD001686 such as MeSHD014945, MeSHD014024 MeSHD012038, and MeSHD009369 MeSHD009362, MeSHD002477 must navigate through complex, three-dimensional extracellular MeSHD014024. To better understand the mechanisms behind these MeSHD001686, it is important to examine the MeSHD012380 of the MeSHD011506 responsible for driving MeSHD002465. Here, we MeSHD020489 a protocol to study the mechanisms of MeSHD002465 using the MeSHD004847 line (MDCK), and a three-dimensional, fibrous, MeSHD004532-polymerizing matrix as a model system. This optically clear MeSHD005109 is easily amenable to live-MeSHD002477 imaging studies and better mimics the physiological, soft MeSHD014024 MeSHD004777. This MeSHD058028 demonstrates a technique for directly visualizing MeSHD011506 localization and dynamics, and deformation of the surrounding three-dimensional matrix. Examination of MeSHD011506 localization and dynamics during cellular processes provides key insight into MeSHD011506 MeSHQ000502. Genetically encoded fluorescent tags provide a unique MeSHD008722 for observing MeSHD011506 localization and dynamics. Using this technique, we can analyze the subcellular accumulation of key, force-generating cytoskeletal components in real-MeSHD013995 as the MeSHD002477 maneuvers through the matrix. In addition, using multiple fluorescent tags with different wavelengths, we can examine the localization of multiple MeSHD011506 simultaneously, thus allowing us to test, for example, whether different MeSHD011506 have similar or divergent MeSHD012380. Furthermore, the dynamics of fluorescently tagged MeSHD011506 can be quantified using Fluorescent Recovery After MeSHD038761 (FRAP) MeSHQ000032. This measurement assays the MeSHD011506 mobility and how stably bound the MeSHD011506 are to the cytoskeletal network. By combining live-MeSHD002477 imaging with the MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD011506 MeSHQ000502 MeSHQ000037, we can examine in real-MeSHD013995 the changes in the MeSHQ000600 of MeSHD011506 and MeSHQ000033 of migrating MeSHD002477. Furthermore, we also combine live-MeSHD002477 imaging with the MeSHQ000706 of fluorescent tracer particles embedded within the matrix to visualize the matrix deformation during MeSHD002465. Thus, we can visualize how a migrating MeSHD002477 distributes force-generating MeSHD011506, and where the MeSHD014143 forces are exerted to the surrounding matrix. Through these MeSHQ000379, we can gain valuable insight into the MeSHD012380 of specific MeSHD011506 and their contributions to the mechanisms of MeSHD002465.
28462395	MeSHD002147 and MeSHD019869 Signaling in KRAS MeSHD009369.	MeSHD002147 (CaM) uniquely promotes signaling of oncogenic K-Ras; but not N-Ras or H-Ras. How CaM interacts with K-Ras and how this stimulates MeSHD049109 are among the most challenging questions in KRAS-driven MeSHD009369. Earlier data pointed to formation of a ternary complex consisting of K-Ras, MeSHD019869α and CaM. Recent data point to phosphorylated CaM binding to the MeSHD018909 of the p85 subunit of MeSHD019869α and activating it. Modeling suggests that the high affinity interaction between the phosphorylated CaM MeSHD014443 motif and MeSHD019869α, can promote full MeSHD019869α activation by oncogenic K-Ras. Our up-to-date MeSHD016454 discusses CaM's MeSHD012380 in MeSHD019869 signaling at the MeSHD008566 in KRAS-driven MeSHD009369. This is significant since it may help MeSHQ000254 of K-Ras-specific MeSHQ000494.
27019795	Clinical MeSHQ000254 of reovirus for MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000628: An MeSHD050504 with immune-mediated antitumor activity.	Reovirus is a MeSHD012330 MeSHD014780 with demonstrated oncolysis or preferential replication in MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477. The oncolytic properties of reovirus appear to be dependent, in part, on activated Ras signaling. In addition, Ras-transformation promotes reovirus oncolysis by affecting several steps of the viral MeSHD008018. Reovirus-mediated MeSHD007109 can present barriers to MeSHD009369 targeting, serve protective MeSHQ000502 against reovirus systemic MeSHQ000633, and contribute to MeSHD013812 efficacy through antitumor immune-mediated effects via innate and adaptive responses. Preclinical studies have demonstrated the broad anticancer activity of wild-type, unmodified type 3 Dearing MeSHD013180 reovirus (MeSHC000632500(®)) across a spectrum of MeSHD009369. The MeSHQ000254 of reovirus as an MeSHD000970 and available clinical data reported from 22 MeSHD016430 MeSHD014836 be reviewed.
21683563	Feasibility of case-based beam generation for robotic MeSHD016634.	Robotic MeSHD016634 MeSHQ000706 the kinematic MeSHD018583 of a robotic MeSHD001132 to target MeSHD009369 and lesions from many different MeSHC029931. This approach allows to focus the dose to the target region while sparing healthy surrounding MeSHD014024. However, the MeSHD018583 in the placement of MeSHQ000628 beams is also a challenge during MeSHQ000628 planning. We study an approach to make the search for MeSHQ000628 beams more efficient by considering previous MeSHQ000628 plans. METHODS AND MATERIAL: Conventionally, a beam generation MeSHD000066506 based on randomly selected candidate beams has been proven to be most robust in clinical practice. However, for prevalent types of MeSHD009369 similarities in MeSHD010361 MeSHQ000033 and dose MeSHD055656 exist. We present a case-based approach that introduces a problem specific MeSHD014894 of similarity and allows to generate candidate beams from a MeSHD019991 of previous MeSHQ000628 plans. Similarity between MeSHQ000628 is established based on MeSHD011385 of the organs and structures considered during planning, and the desired dose MeSHQ000600. Solving the inverse planning problem a subset of MeSHQ000628 beams is determined and adapted to the new clinical case. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the new approach MeSHD007854 to comparable plan quality for substantially fewer candidate beams. For two MeSHD011467 cases, the dose homogeneity in the target region and the sparing of critical structures is similar for plans based on 400 and 600 candidate beams generated with the novel and the conventional MeSHD008722, respectively. However, the runtime for solving the inverse planning problem for could be reduced by up to 47%, i.e., from approximately 19 min to less than 11 min. We have shown the feasibility of case-based beam generation for robotic MeSHD016634. For prevalent clinical cases with similar MeSHQ000033 the cased-based approach could substantially reduce planning MeSHD013995 while maintaining high plan quality.
25190643	Differentiating neural MeSHD012201 responsiveness in MeSHD001321 versus MeSHD001289.	Although MeSHD001289 (MeSHD001289) and MeSHD000067877 (ASD) share certain neurocognitive characteristics, it has been hypothesized to differentiate the two disorders based on their MeSHD001921's MeSHD012201 responsiveness to either social or monetary MeSHD012201. Thus, the present MeSHD008279 study investigated neural activation in response to both MeSHD012201 types in age and IQ-matched MeSHD008571 with MeSHD001289 versus ASD relative to typically MeSHQ000517 (TDC). A significant group by MeSHD012201 type interaction effect emerged in the MeSHD066328 with greater activation to monetary versus social MeSHD012201 only in TDC, whereas subjects with MeSHD001289 responded equally strong to both MeSHD012201 types, and subjects with ASD showed low striatal reactivity across both MeSHD012201 conditions. Moreover, disorder-specific neural MeSHQ000002 were revealed, including medial prefrontal hyperactivation in response to social MeSHD012201 in MeSHD001289 versus ventral striatal hypoactivation in response to monetary MeSHD012201 in ASD. Shared MeSHQ000503 was characterized by fronto-striato-parietal hypoactivation in both clinical groups when money was at stake. Interestingly, lower neural activation within parietal circuitry was associated with higher autistic traits across the entire study sample. In sum, the present MeSHQ000175 concur with the assumption that both ASD and MeSHD001289 display distinct and shared neural MeSHQ000503 in response to MeSHD012201.
22291694	TRIM5α and Species MeSHD018523 of MeSHD006678/SIV.	MeSHD015497 (MeSHD015497) infects MeSHD006801 and MeSHD002679 but not MeSHD002520 (OWMs) such as the MeSHD008253 (Rh) and MeSHD008252 (CM). MeSHD015497 efficiently enters MeSHD002477 of OWMs but encounters a block before MeSHD048348. This narrow MeSHD058507 is attributed to a barrier in the host MeSHD002477. In 2004, the MeSHQ000175 of a Rh MeSHD015723 identified tripartite motif 5α (TRIM5α) as a cellular MeSHD000998 factor. TRIM5α is one of splicing variants produced by TRIM5 MeSHD005796 and TRIM5 MeSHD011506 are members of the TRIM MeSHD005190 containing RING, B-box 2, and coiled-coil domains. The RING domain is frequently found in MeSHD044767 and TRIM5α is degraded via the MeSHD025801-MeSHD046988-dependent pathway. Among TRIM5 splicing variants, TRIM5α alone has an additional C-terminal PRYSPRY (B30.2) domain. Previous studies have shown that sequence variation in variable regions of the MeSHD000071197 among different MeSHD000882 species MeSHD000339 species-specific MeSHD012192, while MeSHD000595 differences in the viral MeSHD036022 determine viral MeSHD012680 to restriction. TRIM5α recognizes the multimerized MeSHD036022 (viral core) of an incoming MeSHD014780 by its MeSHD000071197 and is thus believed to MeSHQ000517 retroviral MeSHD007239. There are significant intraspecies variations in the Rh-TRIM5 MeSHD005796. It has also been reported that some Rh and CM individuals have retrotransposed MeSHD021984 MeSHD016366 in the TRIM5 MeSHD005796, which produces TRIM5-MeSHD021984 fusion MeSHD011506 (TRIMCyp). TRIMCyp, which was originally identified as an anti-MeSHD015497 factor of New World MeSHD016645, is an interesting example of the gain of a new MeSHQ000502 by retrotransposition. As different TRIM5 MeSHD005838 of Rh showed different levels of MeSHD015302 replication in vivo, the TRIM5 genotyping is MeSHD013850 to be important in MeSHD000163 MeSHD000882 models.
26604947	MeSHD001842 MeSHD019737 and mesenchimal MeSHD013234: clinical MeSHD019370 and histological MeSHQ000032.	Autologous MeSHD001842, for its osteoconductive, osteoinductive and osteogenetic properties, has been considered to be the MeSHD006046 standard for MeSHD008443 augmentation MeSHQ000379. MeSHD064592 MeSHQ000379 bring also some disadvantages: sometimes the limited amount of available intraoral MeSHD001842 makes necessary to obtain MeSHD001842 from an extraoral site, and this carries an associated MeSHD009017. To overcome this problem we started using homologous freeze-dried MeSHD001842 in MeSHD008443 augmentation MeSHQ000379. This MeSHD001842 is industrially processed with γ-irradiation to eliminate its MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000635 potential and it's considered safe, but this MeSHQ000628 also eliminates the osteoinductive and osteogenetic properties, making it just an inert scaffold for MeSHD012038. MeSHD059630 are successfully used in and MeSHD019637 for their amplification potential of healing mechanisms. We assumed that MeSHD059630 can restore the osteogenetic and osteoinductive properties in homologous MeSHD001842 MeSHQ000637. The aim of this study was an histological evaluation of MeSHD001861 in MeSHD008443 elevation using: 1) MeSHD059630 engineered freeze-dried MeSHD001842 MeSHD064591; 2) freeze-dried MeSHD001842 MeSHD064591. Twenty MeSHD010361 (10M, 10F) with a mean age of 55.2 years affected by severe maxillary MeSHD001284 were treated with bilateral MeSHD008443 MeSHD005430 elevation. For each MeSHD010361 were randomly assigned a "test" side and a "MeSHQ000517" side, different from each other exclusively in the composition of the MeSHD019737 material. The "MeSHQ000517" sides were composed by corticocancellous freeze-dried MeSHD001842 chips and the "test" sides were composed by corticocancellous freeze-dried MeSHD001842 chips engineered in a MeSHD059630 concentrate. After three months MeSHD001842 MeSHQ000473 were performed on the MeSHQ000637 and histological specimens were made in order to evaluate the healed MeSHD001842 from an histological point of view. Histologically all the specimens showed active remodelling MeSHQ000175 and all the MeSHD014024 were free of inflammatory MeSHD002477. "MeSHQ000517" side specimens showed a substantial persistence of the grafted MeSHD001842 and, with the interposition of MeSHD003238, a considerable amount of newly formed MeSHD001842. "Test" side specimens showed a much more represented cellular component compared to the "MeSHQ000517" sides. The grafted MeSHD001842 trabeculae, when detectable, were completely imprisoned inside new formed MeSHD001842, in direct contact with it and without interposition of MeSHD003238. Freeze-dried MeSHD001842 can be used successfully as MeSHD019737 material in the MeSHQ000628 of maxillary MeSHD001284. The same MeSHD001842 engineered with MeSHD013234 showed a greater histological integration potential comparable with MeSHD064592 histological MeSHQ000033. Further studies are needed to confirm these hypotheses.
19551375	Can illusory deviant stimuli be used as attentional distractors to MeSHD011996 vMMN in a passive three stimulus oddball paradigm?	A passive three stimulus oddball paradigm was used to investigate Visual Mismatch Negativity (vMMN) a component of the MeSHD005071 (ERP) believed to represent a central pre-attentive change mechanism. Responses to a change in MeSHD009949 were recorded to monochrome stimuli presented to subjects on a MeSHD003201 screen. One of the infrequent stimuli formed an illusory figure (Kanizsa Square) aimed to capture spatial MeSHD001288 in the absence of an active task. Nineteen MeSHD004566 (10-20 system) were used to MeSHD011996 the MeSHD004569 in fourteen subjects (ten MeSHD005260) mean age 34.5 years. ERPs to all stimuli consisted of a positive negative positive complex recorded maximally over lateral occipital areas. The negative component was greater for deviant and illusory deviant compared to standard stimuli in a MeSHD013995 window of 170-190 ms. A P3a component over frontal/central MeSHD004566 to the illusory deviant but not to the deviant stimulus suggests the illusory figure was able to capture MeSHD001288 and orientate subjects to the recording. Subtraction waveforms revealed visual discrimination responses at occipital MeSHD004566, which may represent vMMN. In a MeSHQ000517 study with 13 subjects (11 MeSHD005260; mean age 29.23 years), using an embedded active MeSHD001288 task, we confirmed the existence of an earlier (150-170 ms) and attenuated vMMN. Recordings from an intracranial MeSHD002363 confirmed MeSHD004243 of N1 and discrimination components to posterior and anterior occipital areas, respectively. We conclude that although the illusory figure captured spatial MeSHD001288 in its own right it did not draw sufficient attentional MeSHD006295 from the standard-deviant comparison as revealed when using a concurrent active task.
23707234	Metaproteomics of our MeSHD064307 - developing insight in MeSHQ000502 and activity in man and model systems.	We are all colonized by a large MeSHD064307, a complex set of microbes that have intimate MeSHD001244 with us. MeSHQ000208-based approaches have provided insights in the complexity of the MeSHD064307 living on surfaces inside and outside the body. However, the application of MeSHD059014 MeSHD013672 has identified large numbers of MeSHD012111 members at both the phylogenetic and the (meta-)MeSHD016678 level. The latter allowed defining a reference set of several millions of mainly MeSHD005798 and provided the basis for developing approaches to target the activity and MeSHQ000502 of the MeSHD064307 with proteomic MeSHQ000379. Moreover, recent improvements in MeSHD011506 and MeSHD010455 MeSHD004243 MeSHD004526 and highly accurate mass spectrometers have promoted the field of metaproteomics, the study of the collective MeSHD020543 of MeSHD064307. We here MeSHD016454 the approaches that have been developed to study the MeSHD006801 metaproteomes, focusing on intestinal tract and MeSHD001826. Moreover, we MeSHD003165 these by considering metaproteomic studies in MeSHD051379 and other model systems offering the option to study single species or simple consortia. Finally, we discuss present and MeSHD005544 avenues that may be used to advance the application of metaproteomic approaches to further improve our MeSHD032882 of the microbes inside and around our body.

26667192	Chronic MeSHD013315 as a MeSHD012307 of MeSHD010024.	MeSHD010024, the most common metabolic skeletal MeSHD004194, is characterized by decreased MeSHD001842 mass and deteriorated MeSHD001842 quality, leading to increased fracture MeSHD012306. With the MeSHD000375 of the MeSHD011153, MeSHD058866 is an important MeSHD011634 issue. Organisms are constantly exposed to various stressful stimuli that MeSHD000339 MeSHD010829. Recent studies showed that chronic MeSHD013315 is a MeSHD012307 for MeSHD010024 by various signaling pathways. The purpose of this article is to MeSHD016454 the recent progress of the MeSHD001244 between chronic MeSHD013315 and MeSHD010024. Increasing evidence confirms the physiological importance of the MeSHD002490, especially the MeSHD007031, in the MeSHD012926 of MeSHD001842 MeSHQ000378. Both MeSHD000818 and MeSHD006801 studies indicate that chronic MeSHD013315 induces a decrease of MeSHD001842 mass and deterioration of MeSHD001842 quality by influencing the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, MeSHD013564, and other endocrine, MeSHD007155. Active MeSHD008409, proven to be an effective stress-MeSHD000223, can attenuate stress-induced neuroendocrine responses and ameliorate stress-induced MeSHD001842 loss. Therefore, active MeSHD008409 may represent a useful approach in preventing and/or treating chronic stress-associated MeSHD010024. We also discuss several potential mechanisms involved in the interaction between chronic stress, MeSHD008409 and MeSHD010024. Chronic stress activates the HPA axis and MeSHD013564, suppresses the MeSHQ000378 of MeSHD042341 and MeSHD013006, and increases inflammatory MeSHD016207, eventually leading to MeSHD001842 loss by inhibiting MeSHD010012 and stimulating MeSHD001862.
22149148	MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD007875 spp. in MeSHD014867 systems of MeSHD006761 and hotels in South Western MeSHD006115.	The aim of the present study was to determine the MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD007875 spp. in MeSHD014867 systems of MeSHD006761 and hotels located in South Western MeSHD006115, to study the MeSHD017720 of the isolated MeSHD013180 and their possible MeSHD001244 with bacterial contamination (total count and MeSHD011550), the MeSHD014867 MeSHD006863, and MeSHD013696. A MeSHQ000453 MeSHD011795 for MeSHD007875 spp. by culturing MeSHQ000379 in MeSHD014867 MeSHQ000600 systems of eight MeSHD006761 and nine hotels occurred in South Western MeSHD006115. MeSHD014867 sampling and microbiological MeSHQ000032 were carried out following the ISO MeSHQ000379. MeSHD016952 was detected in 33% and 36% of the MeSHQ000600 systems of MeSHD006761 and hotels, respectively. Our MeSHD011795 results suggest a frequent MeSHQ000453 of elevated concentrations of MeSHD007875 spp. in MeSHD014867 systems of MeSHD006761 and hotels. Our investigation has confirmed the need to regularly monitor the microbiological condition of MeSHD014867 systems in MeSHD006761 and hotels.
24611451	Suppression of allo-MeSHD006801 leucocyte MeSHD000941 (HLA) MeSHD000906 secreted by B MeSHD008568 MeSHD002477 MeSHD066298: MeSHD016756 (IVIg) versus a monoclonal anti-HLA-E MeSHD007074 that mimics HLA-I reactivities of IVIg.	B MeSHD008568 MeSHD002477 remain in circulation and secrete MeSHD007518 without MeSHD000941 exposure > 20 years after alloimmunization MeSHD049590 or by MeSHQ000637. These long-lived B MeSHD002477 are resistant to MeSHD054697. Therapeutically, MeSHD016756 (IVIg) is administered to reduce allo-MeSHD006801 leucocyte MeSHD000941 (HLA) MeSHD000906 pre- and post-MeSHQ000637, but the mechanism of reduction remains unclear. Recently, we reported that IVIg reacts with several HLA-I MeSHD000483 and the HLA reactivity of IVIg is lost after its HLA-E reactivity is adsorbed out. Therefore, we have generated an anti-HLA-E MeSHD000911 that mimics the HLA-reactivity of IVIg to investigate whether this antibody suppresses MeSHD007074 MeSHQ000378, as does IVIg. B MeSHD002477 were purified from the MeSHQ000097 of a MeSHD014930 in whose MeSHQ000097 the B MeSHD008568 MeSHD002477 remained without MeSHD000941 exposure > 20 years after MeSHD049590 alloimmunization. The B MeSHD002477 were stimulated with MeSHD016207 using a well-defined MeSHQ000208 system. The anti-HLA-E MeSHD000911 (mAb) significantly suppressed the allo-HLA class-II MeSHD007074 produced by the B MeSHD002477, and that this suppression was far superior to that by IVIg. These MeSHQ000175 were confirmed with HLA-I antibody secreted by the immortalized B MeSHD002460, developed from the MeSHQ000097 of another alloimmunized MeSHD014930. The binding affinity of the anti-HLA-E mAb for MeSHD010455 sequences shared (i.e. shared MeSHD000939) between HLA-E and other β2-microglobulin-free HLA heavy chains (open conformers) on the MeSHD002477 surface of B MeSHD002477 may act as a MeSHD008024 and signal suppression of MeSHD007074 MeSHD004467 of activated B MeSHD008568 MeSHD002477. We propose that anti-HLA-E MeSHD000911 may also be useful to suppress allo-HLA MeSHD007074 MeSHD004467 in vivo.
19286830	Evolutionary construction of multiple graph alignments for the structural MeSHQ000032 of biomolecules.	The concept of multiple graph alignment (MGA) has recently been introduced as a novel MeSHD008722 for the structural MeSHQ000032 of biomolecules. Using approximate graph matching MeSHQ000379, this MeSHD008722 enables the robust identification of approximately conserved patterns in biologically related structures. In particular, MGA enables the characterization of functional MeSHD011506 MeSHD005190 independent of sequence or fold homology. This article first recalls the concept of MGA and then MeSHD019484 the problem of computing optimal alignments from an algorithmic point of view. In this regard, a MeSHD008722 from the field of evolutionary MeSHD000465 is proposed and empirically compared with a hitherto existing MeSHD000066506 approach. Empirically, it is shown that the former yields significantly better results than the latter, albeit at the MeSHD003365 of an increased runtime.
25034229	Improved resolution of MeSHQ000382 by high throughput MeSHD017421 of the rRNA internal transcribed spacer.	Current MeSHD059014 (HTS) MeSHQ000379 are limited in their MeSHD001076 to resolve MeSHQ000382 at or below the genus level. While the impact of this limitation may be relatively MeSHD033242 in whole-MeSHD012111 analyses, it constrains the MeSHQ000706 of HTS as a tool for identifying and examining individual MeSHQ000382 of interest. The limited resolution is a consequence of both short read lengths and insufficient sequence variation within the commonly targeted variable regions of the small-subunit rRNA (SSU) MeSHD005796. The MeSHD006040 of this MeSHD014937 was to improve the resolving MeSHD011209 of bacterial HTS. We developed an MeSHQ000032 targeting the hypervariable rRNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region residing between the SSU and large-subunit (LSU) MeSHD020459. Comparisons of the ITS region and two SSU regions using annotated MeSHD016680 in MeSHD030561 showed much greater resolving MeSHD011209 is possible with the ITS region. This MeSHD058028 presents a new HTS MeSHD008722 for analyzing bacterial composition with improved capabilities. The greater resolving MeSHD011209 enabled by the ITS region arises from its high sequence variation across a wide range of bacterial taxa and an associated decrease in taxonomic heterogeneity within its OTUs. Although the MeSHD008722 should be adaptable to any HTS platform, this MeSHD058028 presents MeSHD016133 primers, amplification parameters, and protocols for Illumina-based analyses.
22691468	Antimicrobials for reduction of MeSHD012475 contamination in uncooked, surface-browned breaded MeSHD002645 products.	Surface-browned but uncooked frozen breaded MeSHD002645 products have been associated with MeSHD012480 MeSHD004196 due to inadequate or no MeSHD003296 of the products before MeSHD004467. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of three antimicrobials against MeSHD012475 during  manufacture of a surface-browned, uncooked frozen breaded MeSHD002645 MeSHD008461. Fresh MeSHD002645 MeSHD001940 MeSHD008460 portions (5 by 5 by 5 cm) were inoculated (4 to 5 log CFU/g) with MeSHD012475 and mixed with MeSHC031492 (CAA; 0.5 and 1.0%), MeSHC073316 (CAR; 0.3 and 0.5%), ε-MeSHD011107 (POL;  0.125 and 0.25%), or distilled MeSHD014867 (MeSHQ000517). MeSHD012965 (1.2%) and MeSHC005692 (0.3%) were added to all MeSHQ000628, and the mixtures were ground (5% total moisture enhancement level) and formed into portions (9 by 5 by 3 cm). The products were breaded and surface browned  by baking in an oven (208°C for 15 min) or deep frying in MeSHD010938 (190°C for 15 s), packaged in MeSHD020959 bags, and stored at -20°C for 7 days. Total reductions of inoculated MeSHD012475 in untreated MeSHQ000517 oven- or fryer-browned products after frozen storage  were 1.2 and 0.8 log CFU/g, respectively. In comparison, MeSHQ000628 with CAA, CAR, or POL reduced initial pathogen counts by 3.3 to >4.5, 4.1 to >4.7, and 1.1 to 1.6 log CFU/g, respectively, regardless of the antimicrobial concentration and browning MeSHD008722. MeSHQ000628 with 1.0% CAA (oven  browned) or 0.5% CAR (oven or fryer browned) reduced MeSHD012475 to nondetectable levels (<0.3 log CFU/g) in stored frozen products. These data may be useful for MeSHQ000254 of suitable antimicrobial MeSHQ000628 to reduce the MeSHD012306 of MeSHD012475 contamination in surface-browned,  uncooked frozen breaded MeSHD002645 products.
23203190	The MeSHD010703 fraction from MeSHD031286 MeSHD012639 oil: potential and limits for MeSHD000069601 against MeSHD007313 pests.	The MeSHD031286 shrub, MeSHD031286 (MeSHD019665), has been considered as a "miracle MeSHD014197", particularly as a source of alternate fuel. Various extracts of the MeSHD010944 have been reported to have insecticidal/acaricidal or molluscicidal/anthelminthic activities on vectors of medical or MeSHQ000662 interest or on agricultural or non-agricultural pests. Among those extracts, the MeSHD010703 fraction from MeSHD012639 oil has been reported as a promising candidate for MeSHQ000706 as a MeSHD010944-derived protectant of a variety of crops, from a range of pre-harvest and post-harvest MeSHD007313 pests. However, such extracts have not been widely used, despite the "boom" in the MeSHQ000254 of the crop in the tropics during recent years, and societal concerns about overuse of systemic chemical MeSHD010575. There are many potential explanations to such a lack of MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD031286 insecticidal extracts. On the one MeSHD006225, the application of extracts potentially harmful to MeSHD006801 MeSHD006262 on stored MeSHD005502 grain, might not be relevant. The problem of decomposition of MeSHD010703 and other compounds toxic to crop pests in the field needing further evaluation before such extracts can be widely used, may also be a partial explanation. High variability of MeSHD010703 content and hence of insecticidal activity among MeSHD031286 cultivars/MeSHD060146 may be another. Phytotoxicity to crops may be further limitation. Apparent obstacles to a wider application of such extracts are the MeSHD003365 and problems involved with registration and legal approval. On the other MeSHD006225, more studies should be conducted on molluscicidal activity on MeSHD049851 and land MeSHD012908 which are major pests of crops, particularly in conservation MeSHD000383 systems. Further evaluation of MeSHQ000633 to natural enemies of MeSHD007313 pests and studies on other beneficial MeSHD007313 such as pollinators are also needed.
20117850	Unveiling the MeSHD012380 of network and MeSHD049490 in MeSHD055808.	Network and MeSHD049490 offer a novel way of approaching MeSHD055808 by developing models that consider the global physiological MeSHD004777 of MeSHD011506 targets, and the effects of modifying them, without losing the key molecular details. Here we MeSHD016454 some recent advances in network and MeSHD049490 applied to MeSHD006801 MeSHD006262, and discuss how they can have a big impact on some of the most interesting areas of MeSHD055808. In particular, we claim that network MeSHD001695 MeSHD014836 MeSHD010988 a central part in the MeSHQ000254 of novel MeSHD064798 strategies to fight complex multifactorial MeSHD004194, where efficacious MeSHQ000628 MeSHD014836 need to center on altering entire pathways rather than single MeSHD011506. We briefly present new MeSHQ000254 in the two areas where we believe network and system MeSHD001695 strategies are more likely to have an immediate contribution: predictive MeSHD014116 and MeSHD058492.
26554009	Choosing experiments to accelerate collective discovery.	A scientist's choice of MeSHD012106 problem MeSHD000339 his or her personal career trajectory. Scientists' combined choices MeSHD000339 the MeSHC029931 and MeSHD004526 of scientific discovery as a whole. In this MeSHD010209, we infer preferences that shape problem selection from patterns of published MeSHQ000175 and then quantify their MeSHD004526. We represent MeSHD012106 problems as links between scientific entities in a MeSHD019359 network. We then build a generative model of discovery informed by MeSHD036301 on scientific problem selection. We MeSHD019532 salient features from this MeSHD008091 to key network properties: an entity's importance corresponds to its degree centrality, and a problem's difficulty corresponds to the network distance it spans. MeSHD020472 on millions of MeSHD010209 and MeSHD020490 published over 30 years, we MeSHQ000706 this model to infer the typical MeSHD012107 used to explore chemical relationships in biomedicine. This strategy generates conservative MeSHD012106 choices focused on building up MeSHD019359 around important molecules. These choices become more conservative over MeSHD013995. The observed strategy is efficient for initial exploration of the network and supports scientific careers that require steady output, but is inefficient for MeSHD012586 as a whole. Through supercomputer experiments on a sample of the network, we study thousands of alternatives and identify strategies much more efficient at exploring mature MeSHD019359 networks. We find that increased MeSHD012309 and the MeSHD011642 of experimental failures would substantially improve the speed of discovery. We consider institutional shifts in MeSHD005381 making, evaluation, and MeSHD011642 that would help realize these MeSHD004526.
20565164	MeSHD017418 of free-response studies, 1992-2008: assessing the MeSHD009622 reduction model in MeSHD010268.	We MeSHD058028 the results of meta-analyses on 3 types of free-response study: (a) ganzfeld (a technique that enhances a MeSHD003142 anomaly referred to as "psi"); (b) nonganzfeld MeSHD009622 reduction using alleged psi-enhancing MeSHQ000379 such as MeSHD004325 psi, MeSHD019122, MeSHD012063, or MeSHD006990; and (c) standard free response (nonganzfeld, no MeSHD009622 reduction). For the period 1997-2008, a homogeneous MeSHD064886 of 29 ganzfeld studies yielded a mean effect size of 0.142 (Stouffer Z = 5.48, p = 2.13 x 10(-8)). A homogeneous nonganzfeld MeSHD009622 reduction MeSHD064886 of 16 studies yielded a mean effect size of 0.110 (Stouffer Z = 3.35, p = 2.08 x 10(-4)), and a homogeneous MeSHD064886 of 14 standard free-response studies produced a weak negative mean effect size of -0.029 (Stouffer Z = -2.29, p = .989). The mean effect size value of the ganzfeld MeSHD019991 was significantly higher than the mean effect size of the standard free-response MeSHD019991 but was not higher than the effect size of the nonganzfeld MeSHD009622 reduction MeSHD019991 [corrected].We also found that selected participants (believers in the paranormal, meditators, etc.) had a performance advantage over unselected participants, but only if they were in the ganzfeld condition.
27924512	Computational MeSHQ000032 reveals MeSHD035683-MeSHD012333 regulatory network in MeSHD000077277.	MeSHD035683 (MeSHD035683) are known to regulate post-transcriptional MeSHD015870. They are involved in MeSHD063646 and MeSHD009369 progression. The aim of this study was to explore the MeSHD035683-MeSHD012333 regulatory network in MeSHD000077277 (ESCC) using comprehensive computational approaches. In this study we have selected a total of 11 MeSHD035683 from one previously reported study in ESCC. The MeSHD012333 targets of these MeSHD035683 were predicted using various MeSHD000465. The expression profiles of these MeSHD012333 targets were identified on MeSHD020411 experiment MeSHD064886 across ESCC MeSHD014024 samples. Based on the MeSHD035683-MeSHD012333 regulatory relationships, the network was inferred. A total of 23 MeSHD035683-MeSHD012333 regulatory interactions, with 11 MeSHD035683 and 13 MeSHD012333 targets, were inferred in ESCC. The MeSHD035683-MeSHD012333 regulatory network with increased confidence provides insights into the progression of ESCC and may serve as a MeSHD015415 for MeSHD011379 or the aggressiveness of ESCC. However, the results should be examined with further experimental validation.
27212712	VUV photo-processing of PAH MeSHD002412: quantitative study on the ionization versus fragmentation processes.	Interstellar MeSHD011084 (PAHs) are strongly affected by the MeSHD000042 of MeSHD014618 ultraviolet (VUV) MeSHD017785 in the interstellar medium (ISM), yet the branching ratio between ionization and fragmentation is poorly studied. This is crucial for the stability and MeSHD005249 state of PAHs in the ISM in different MeSHD004777, affecting in turn the MeSHD002621, the energy balance, and the contribution of PAHs to the extinction and emission curves. We studied the interaction of PAH MeSHD002412 with VUV MeSHD017785 in the 7 - 20 eV range from the MeSHD017356 SOLEIL beamline, DESIRS. We recorded by action MeSHD013057 the relative intensities of photo-fragmentation and photo-ionization for a set of eight PAH MeSHD002412 ranging in size from 14 to 24 MeSHD002244 atoms, with different structures. At photon energies below ~13.6 eV fragmentation dominates for the smaller species, while for larger species ionization is immediately competitive after the second ionization potential (IP). At higher photon energies, all species behave similarly, the ionization yield gradually increases, leveling off between 0.8 and 0.9 at ~18 eV. Among isomers, PAH structure appears to mainly MeSHD000339 the fragmentation cross section, but not the ionization cross section. We also measured the second IP for all species and the third IP for two of them, all are in good agreement with theoretical ones confirming that PAH MeSHD002412 can be further ionized in the diffuse ISM. Determining actual PAH dication abundances in the ISM MeSHD014836 require detailed modeling. Our measured photo-ionization yields for several PAH MeSHD002412 provide a necessary ingredient for such models.
27655972	Knockdown of Unconventional MeSHD009218 ID Expression Induced Morphological Change in MeSHD009836.	MeSHD009186 is a special multilamellar structure involved in various MeSHQ000502 in the MeSHD009420. In the MeSHD002490, the MeSHD009836 (OL) produces MeSHD009186 and has a unique MeSHQ000033. OLs have a dynamic MeSHD008566 sorting system associated with cytoskeletal MeSHD009938, which aids in the MeSHD004467 of MeSHD009186. Recently, it was reported that the assembly and disassembly of MeSHD008841 is crucial for myelination. However, the partner MeSHD009218 molecule which associates with MeSHD008841 during the myelination process has not yet been identified. One candidate MeSHD009218 is unconventional MeSHD009218 ID (Myo1d) which is distributed throughout MeSHD002490 MeSHD009186; however, its MeSHQ000502 is still unclear. We MeSHD058028 here that Myo1d is expressed during later stages of OL differentiation, together with MeSHD018991 (PLP). In addition, Myo1d is distributed at the leading edge of the MeSHD009186-like MeSHD008566 in cultured OL, colocalizing mainly with MeSHD008841, MeSHD015087 and partially with PLP. Myo1d-knockdown with specific MeSHD034741 induces significant morphological changes such as the retraction of processes and degeneration of MeSHD009186-like MeSHD008566, and finally MeSHD017209. Furthermore, loss of Myo1d by MeSHD034741 results in the impairment of intracellular PLP transport. Together, these results suggest that Myo1d may contribute to MeSHD008566 dynamics either in wrapping or transporting of MeSHD009186 MeSHD008565 during formation and MeSHD008283 of MeSHD009186.
26313191	Effects of MeSHD013696 on the MeSHD015993 Parameters of Trichogramma zahiri (MeSHD006927: Trichogrammatidae), an MeSHD010063 Parasitoid of Dicladispa armigera (Chrysomelidae: MeSHD001517).	The influence of different MeSHD013696 on MeSHD001688 parameters of native MeSHD013180 of Trichogramma zahiri Polaszek (MeSHD006927: Trichogrammatidae), an MeSHD010063 parasitoid of MeSHD012275 hispa, Dicladispa armigera (Olivier) (Chrysomelidae: MeSHD001517), was evaluated in the MeSHD007753 on its host. The key MeSHD001688 parameters of the parasitoid T. zahiri in relation to MeSHD013696 were investigated to find out its candidature as a potential MeSHD061046 of MeSHD012275 hispa. The highest number of MeSHD010063 parasitized by T. zahiri was 15.7 MeSHD010063 per MeSHD005260 at 26 °C, which differed significantly from those at 18, 22, 30, and 34 °C (P < 0.05). MeSHQ000254 duration and MeSHD008136 of T. zahiri decreased as MeSHD013696 increased. MeSHD005298 differed significantly at all constant MeSHD013696. Emergence rates decreased at both high (34 °C) and low ( < 26 °C) MeSHD013696. MeSHD005260-biased MeSHD012744 ranged from 54 to 70% at all constant MeSHD013696. The lower MeSHD013696 threshold for T. zahiri was 6.2 °C for MeSHD008297 and 6.95 °C for MeSHD005260. The upper threshold MeSHD013696 were 35.82 and 35.87 °C for MeSHD008297 and MeSHD005260, respectively. Net reproductive rate (R0) was highest at 26 °C compared with other MeSHD013696. Mean cohort generation MeSHD013995 (tG) and MeSHD011153 doubling MeSHD013995 (tD) decreased as MeSHD013696 increased from 18 to 30 °C. The daily intrinsic rate of increase (rm) and finite rate of increase (λ) were positively correlated with MeSHD013696 ranging from 18 to 30 °C and then decreased at 34 °C. The relevance of our results is discussed in the context of climatic adaptation and MeSHD001688 MeSHQ000517.
18383230	Mycoflora associated with MeSHD032304 muticus growing under an extremely arid desert MeSHD004777 (Aswan region, MeSHD004534).	MeSHD032304 muticus L. (Egyptian MeSHD032304) is one of the desert MeSHD010946 of MeSHD005190 MeSHD019657. The MeSHD010944 produces pharmaceutically important compounds (tropane MeSHD000470) as MeSHQ000556 metabolites. In the present study, we describe mycoflora of H. muticus grown in four different locations in Egyptian southern desert (Aswan region): Aswan MeSHD014495 campus, Wadi Allaqi down MeSHD045483 part, Aswan MeSHD059028 road, and Sahari city. Eighty-one species and two varieties belonging to 31 genera were isolated from MeSHD012987 surrounding H. muticus MeSHD010944, the surface of the MeSHD010944, and inside the MeSHD010944 as endophytic MeSHD005658. MeSHD001230 was the most common genus in all study areas. The highest number of genera and species of MeSHD005658 were recorded in Aswan MeSHD014495 campus followed by Aswan MeSHD059028 road. Fungal diversity MeSHQ000032 revealed that these two locations have higher fungal diversity compared to other two locations. A higher number of fungal species were isolated from MeSHD058441 MeSHD012987 and rhizoplane than from non-MeSHD058441 and other MeSHD010944 organs. Endophytic MeSHD005658 were isolated from all MeSHD010944 parts of H. muticus. MeSHD003142 between H. muticus MeSHD010944 and MeSHD005658 under desert conditions both in MeSHD058441 and inside the MeSHD010944 are deduced.
22829625	Nebula--a web-server for advanced MeSHD000081204 MeSHD000078332.	MeSHD000081204 consists of MeSHD047369 and MeSHD059014 of the extracted MeSHD004247 fragments. It is the technique of choice for accurate characterization of the MeSHD001665 of MeSHD014157 and other MeSHD004247-associated MeSHD011506. We present a web service, Nebula, which allows inexperienced users to perform a complete MeSHD019295 MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD000081204 data. Nebula was designed for both bioinformaticians and biologists. It is based on the MeSHD055608 open source framework. MeSHD055608 already includes a large number of functionalities for mapping reads and peak calling. We added the following to MeSHD055608: (i) peak calling with FindPeaks and a module for MeSHD047468 MeSHD011786, (ii) de novo motif discovery with ChIPMunk, (iii) calculation of the density and the cumulative MeSHQ000600 of peak locations relative to MeSHD005796 MeSHD024363, (iv) annotation of peaks with genomic features and (v) annotation of MeSHD005796 with peak information. Nebula generates the graphs and the enrichment MeSHD020500 at each step of the process. During Steps 3-5, Nebula optionally repeats the MeSHQ000032 on a MeSHQ000517 MeSHD064886 and compares these results with those from the main MeSHD064886. Nebula can also incorporate MeSHD015870 (or MeSHD005796 modulation) data during these steps. In summary, Nebula is an innovative web service that provides an advanced MeSHD000081204 MeSHQ000032 pipeline providing ready-to-publish results. Nebula is available at http://nebula.curie.fr/ SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at MeSHD019295 online.
19889212	Recurrent microdeletion at 17q12 as a cause of Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) MeSHD013577: two MeSHD002363.	MeSHC537371 (MRKH) consists of MeSHQ000151 MeSHQ000002 of the MeSHD014599 and the upper part of MeSHD014621 due to anomalous MeSHQ000254 of Müllerian ducts, either isolated or associated with other MeSHQ000151 MeSHQ000002, including renal, skeletal, MeSHD006309 and MeSHD006321 MeSHQ000002. This disorder has an MeSHD015994 of approximately 1 in 4500 MeSHD007231 MeSHD014930 and the aetiology is poorly understood. we MeSHD058028 on two MeSHD010361 affected by MeSHC537371 in which array-CGH MeSHQ000032 disclosed an identical deletion spanning 1.5 Mb of genomic MeSHD004247 at MeSHD002875 17q12. One MeSHD010361 was affected by complete absence of MeSHD014599 and MeSHD014621, with bilaterally normal MeSHD010053, while the other displayed MeSHQ000002 of the upper part of MeSHD014621, right unicornuate MeSHD014599, non cavitating rudimentary left MeSHD006733 and bilaterally MeSHD021782. The deletion encompassed two candidate MeSHD005796, TCF2 and LHX1. Mutational MeSHQ000175 of these MeSHD005796 in a selected group of 20 MRKH MeSHD005260 without 17q12 deletion was negative. Deletion 17q12 is a rare albeit recurrent anomaly mediated by MeSHD056916, previously reported in subjects with developmental MeSHD007668 MeSHQ000002 and diabetes. The present two MeSHD010361 expand the clinical spectrum associated with this imbalance and suggest that this region is a candidate locus for a subset of MeSHC537371 individuals, with or without renal MeSHQ000002.
23610137	How do MeSHD010361 with MeSHD006333 with preserved ejection fraction die?	MeSHD032882 how MeSHD010361 with MeSHD006333 with preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) die provides insight into the MeSHD019021 and MeSHQ000503 of this complex MeSHD013577, thereby allowing better prediction of response to MeSHQ000628 in designing MeSHD016430. This MeSHD016454 summarizes the current state of MeSHD019359 surrounding MeSHD009026, modes of MeSHD003643, and MeSHD011379 in HFPEF. Despite the lack of MeSHD003020 reporting, the following conclusions may be drawn from previous studies. The MeSHD009026 burden of HFPEF is substantial, ranging from 10% to 30% annually, and higher in MeSHD016021 than in MeSHD016430. MeSHD009026 compared with MeSHD006333 with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF) appear to be strongly influenced by the type of study, but are clearly elevated compared with age- and co-MeSHD009017-matched MeSHQ000517 without MeSHD006333. The majority of MeSHD003643 in HFPEF are cardiovascular MeSHD003643, comprising 51-60% of MeSHD003643 in MeSHD016021 and ∼70% in MeSHD016430. Among cardiovascular MeSHD003643, MeSHD003645 and MeSHD006333 MeSHD003643 are the leading cardiac modes of MeSHD003643 in HFPEF MeSHD016430. Compared with HFREF, the proportions of cardiovascular MeSHD003643, MeSHD003645, and MeSHD006333 MeSHD003643 are lower in HFPEF. Conversely, non-cardiovascular MeSHD003643 constitute a higher proportion of MeSHD003643 in HFPEF than in HFREF, particularly in MeSHD016021, where this difference may be related to fewer coronary MeSHD006321 MeSHD003643 in HFPEF. Key MeSHD009026 MeSHD012307, including age, MeSHD005783, MeSHD015992, burden of co-MeSHD009017, and MeSHD003324, offer some explanation for the differences in MeSHD009026 observed across studies.
18505928	Identification and functional characterization of the MeSHD006801 MeSHD005982 P1 MeSHD005796 as a novel transcriptional target of the p53 MeSHD016147.	The MeSHD005982 P1 (GSTP1) is involved in multiple cellular MeSHQ000502, including phase II MeSHQ000378, stress response, signaling, and MeSHD017209. The mechanisms underlying the significantly high GSTP1 expression in many MeSHD006801 MeSHD009369 are, however, currently not well understood. We MeSHD058028 here that the GSTP1 MeSHD005796 is a heretofore unrecognized downstream transcriptional target of the MeSHD009369 suppressor p53. We identified a p53-binding motif comprising two consecutive half-sites located in MeSHD007438 4 of the GSTP1 MeSHD005796 and is highly homologous to MeSHD032921 p53-binding motifs in other p53-responsive MeSHD005796. Using a combination of MeSHD024202 and MeSHD003850 footprinting analyses, we showed that wild-type p53 MeSHD011506 binds to the GSTP1 p53 motif and MeSHD008156 reporter assays showed the motif to be transcriptionally functional in MeSHD006801 MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477. In a MeSHD013696-sensitive p53-mutant MeSHD002477, levels of both p21/WAF1 and GSTP1 MeSHD005796 transcripts increased MeSHD013995 dependently when MeSHD002477 were switched from the inactive mutant state to the wild-type p53 state. MeSHD034741-mediated reduction of p53 expression resulted in a specific decrease in GSTP1 expression and in MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 with mutated p53; adenovirally mediated expression of wild-type p53 increased GSTP1 expression significantly. In a panel of early-passage MeSHD001932 MeSHQ000208 from MeSHD010361, high levels of GSTP1 transcripts and MeSHD011506 were associated with wild-type p53 and, conversely, low GSTP1 levels with mutant p53. p53 expression knockdown by MeSHD034741 increased MeSHD002945 MeSHD012680. The MeSHD001076 of wild-type p53 to transcriptionally activate the MeSHD006801 GSTP1 MeSHD005796 defines a novel mechanism of protecting the MeSHD016678 and, potentially, of MeSHD009369 MeSHD004351.
22772414	[Clinical MeSHQ000032 of 48 cases of MeSHD016030 from MeSHD003643 MeSHD014019].	To evaluate the recovery of MeSHD010361 with MeSHD007676 (MeSHD007676) receiving MeSHD007668 MeSHD019737 from MeSHD003643 MeSHD014019, and to assess MeSHD006085 in MeSHD002681 from this type of MeSHD014019. A total of 48 cases of MeSHD010361 with MeSHD007676 have received the MeSHD007668 from MeSHD003643 MeSHD014019 in our MeSHD006761 between February 2010 and March 2012. We retrospectively analyzed data on the preoperative and postoperative MeSHD044967 MeSHD003404 concentrations, on the MeSHD013534 of recipients and MeSHD064591 with a view to investigating MeSHD011379 after this type of MeSHD007668 MeSHD019737. Primary non-MeSHQ000502 (PNF) did not occur in any of the 48 recipients. MeSHD051799 (DGF) occurred in 18 of 48 (37.5%) of MeSHD007668 from MeSHD003643 MeSHD014019, but the MeSHQ000453 of DGF did not adversely influence MeSHD010361's MeSHD013534 (P=0.098) or MeSHD006085 (P=0.447). Seven of 48 (14.6%) recipients lost their MeSHD019737. Over a median follow-up period of 8 months (range 0.5-23 months), 39 of 41(95.1%) recipients' MeSHD019737 MeSHQ000502 had fully recovered. The actuarial MeSHD019737 and MeSHD010361's MeSHD015996 at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after MeSHQ000637 were 95.7%, 93.0%, 90.0%, 87.5%, and 100%, 94.9%, 90%, 87.5%, respectively. As the MeSHD020485 of donation after MeSHD001926 (DBD) has not been ratified in MeSHD002681, the MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD007668 from MeSHD003643 MeSHD014019 might be an effective way to increase the number of MeSHD007668 available for MeSHQ000637 here. Our experience indicates good short- and mid-term outcomes with MeSHD019737 from MeSHD003643 MeSHD014019.
20348099	Glutathionylation of MeSHD000226 induced by MeSHD002248 prevents MeSHD051336 permeabilization and MeSHD017209.	The present MeSHD014937 demonstrates the MeSHD001076 of MeSHD002248 to prevent MeSHD017209 in a primary MeSHQ000208 of MeSHD001253. For the first MeSHD013995, the antiapoptotic MeSHD001519 can be clearly attributed to the inhibition of MeSHD051336 permeabilization (MeSHD020782), a key event in the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. In isolated non-synaptic MeSHD008928, MeSHD002248 partially inhibits (i) loss of potential, (ii) the opening of a nonspecific pore through the inner MeSHD008566, (iii) swelling, and (iv) MeSHD045304 release, which are induced by MeSHD002118, MeSHD003958, or MeSHD001278 (a MeSHD008024 of ANT). MeSHD002248 directly modulates ANT MeSHQ000502 by enhancing MeSHD000244/MeSHD000255 exchange and prevents its pore-forming activity. Additionally, MeSHD002248 induces MeSHD017382 (ROS) generation, and its MeSHQ000517 by MeSHD019207 decreases MeSHD002248 MeSHD019610 in intact MeSHD002477 as well as in isolated MeSHD008928, revealing the key MeSHD012380 of ROS. On the other MeSHD006225, MeSHD002248 induces a slight increase in mitochondrial MeSHD019803, which is essential for MeSHD017209 modulation by (i) delaying astrocytic MeSHD017209, (ii) decreasing MeSHD020782, and (iii) enhancing MeSHD000244/MeSHD000255 translocation activity of ANT. Moreover, MeSHD002248 and MeSHD019803 trigger ANT glutathionylation, a post-translational process regulating MeSHD011506 MeSHQ000502 in response to MeSHD010084 cellular changes. In conclusion, MeSHD002248 protects MeSHD001253 from MeSHD017209 by preventing MeSHD020782, acting on ANT (glutathionylation and inhibition of its pore activity) via a preconditioning-like process mediated by ROS and MeSHD019803.
22194600	MeSHC038253 induces signal MeSHD014159 and activator of transcription (STAT) MeSHD011506 MeSHD010766: preclinical and clinical significance in MeSHD006258.	Activity of MeSHC038253 is implicated strongly in dissemination of MeSHQ000556 MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 and MeSHD002477 of the MeSHD007107. In addition, MeSHC038253 enhances the MeSHD010766 of selected signaling molecules, including SRC and EGFR, in a manner that requires MeSHQ000378 but not enzymatic activity of MeSHC038253 and is mediated by its C-terminal domain. Clinically, MeSHC038253 MeSHD013194 is associated with larger MeSHD009369 and increased EGFR MeSHD010766 in MeSHD006257 and MeSHD009333 MeSHD002277. We hypothesized that signal MeSHD014159 and activator of transcription (STAT) MeSHD011506 mediate the protumorigenic MeSHQ000502 of MeSHC038253 downstream of the EGFR. We provide evidence that MeSHC038253 enhances the MeSHD010766 of STAT3 and STAT5b but not STAT5a. Moreover, enhanced proliferation of MeSHC038253 transfected MeSHD002477 was attenuated by STAT3 and STAT5b MeSHD034741, but not STAT5a or STAT1 MeSHD034741. Clinically, STAT3 MeSHD010766 was associated with MeSHD006258 progression, EGFR MeSHD010766, and MeSHC038253 expression and cellular localization. Notably, cytoplasmic rather than nuclear phospho-STAT3 correlated with increased MeSHD009369 size (T-stage; p = 0.007), number of MeSHQ000556 MeSHD009333 MeSHD008198 (p = 0.05), and reduced MeSHD013534 of MeSHD010361 (p = 0.04).
25824549	MeSHD062069 in MeSHD053803: social, legal and MeSHQ000941.	This MeSHD010209 discusses the MeSHD019368 of four waves of MeSHD062069 in MeSHD053803 alongside the social, legal and ethical aspect of these innovations. It emphasises the way in which technological advances and their socio-legal frameworks are co-produced, shaping MeSHD013672 MeSHD009042, MeSHD012933, and legal institutions. It also considers how imagined and actual MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD053803 MeSHD013672 are entangled with assertions about social order, affirmations of common values and MeSHD002961, and promises about security and MeSHD012935. Our MeSHD016420 seek to encourage the participation of scientific actors in the MeSHQ000254 of anticipatory governance deliberations concerning the widening application of MeSHD053803 in an increasing number of MeSHD057237 and civil jurisdictions.
29238751	MeSHD014197 Leaf Bacterial MeSHD012111 Structure and Diversity Differ along a Gradient of Urban Intensity.	MeSHD014197 leaf-associated MeSHD064307 have been studied in natural MeSHD017753 but less so in urban settings, where MeSHD000087602 on MeSHD014197 could impact MeSHD064307 and modify their interaction with their hosts. Additionally, MeSHD014197 act as vectors spreading bacterial MeSHD002477 in the MeSHD000388 in urban MeSHD004777 due to the density of microbial MeSHD002477 on aerial MeSHD010944 surfaces. Characterizing MeSHD014197 leaf bacterial MeSHD012111 along an urban gradient is thus key to understand the impact of MeSHD000087602 on urban MeSHD014197-bacterium interactions and on the MeSHD016424 urban MeSHD064307. In this study, we aimed (i) to characterize phyllosphere bacterial MeSHD012111 of seven MeSHD014197 species in urban MeSHD004777 and (ii) to describe the changes in MeSHD014197 phyllosphere bacterial MeSHD012111 structure and diversity along a gradient of increasing urban intensity and at two degrees of MeSHD014197 MeSHQ000302. Our results indicate that, as MeSHD000087602 increase, urban leaf bacterial MeSHD012111 show a reduction in the abundance of the dominant class in the natural MeSHD010944 MeSHD064307, the MeSHD020561. Our MeSHD014937 in the urban MeSHD004777 here reveals that the structures of leaf bacterial MeSHD012111 differ along the gradient of urban intensity. The diversity of phyllosphere MeSHD064307 increases at higher urban intensity, also displaying a greater number and variety of associated MeSHD007202 taxa than the low and medium urban gradient sites. In conclusion, we find that urban MeSHD004777 influence MeSHD014197 bacterial MeSHD012111 composition, and our results suggest that MeSHD005246 between MeSHD006802 and MeSHD010944 MeSHD064307 could shape urban MeSHD064307. IMPORTANCE In natural MeSHD065928, MeSHD014197 leaf surfaces host diverse bacterial MeSHD012111 whose structure and composition are primarily driven by host species identity. MeSHD014197 leaf bacterial diversity has also been shown to influence MeSHD014197 MeSHD012111 MeSHD004526, a key MeSHQ000502 of terrestrial MeSHD017753. However, most urban MeSHD064307 studies have focused on the MeSHD000076624, improving our MeSHD032882 of indoor MeSHD064307 but leaving much to be understood, especially in the nonbuilt MeSHD064307. Here, we provide the first multiple-species comparison of MeSHD014197 phyllosphere MeSHD056226 and diversity along a gradient of urban intensity. We demonstrate that urban MeSHD014197 possess characteristic bacterial MeSHD012111 that differ from those seen with MeSHD014197 in nonurban MeSHD004777, with MeSHD064307 on MeSHD014197 influenced by host species identity but also by the gradient of urban intensity and by the degree of MeSHQ000302 from other MeSHD014197. Our results suggest that MeSHD005246 between MeSHD006802 and MeSHD010944 MeSHD064307 could shape urban MeSHD064307.
22513523	Does state MeSHD002017 MeSHD011312 matter for MeSHD017664 spending in MeSHD006761? MeSHQ000175 from MeSHD013781 and MeSHD002140.	This study examined the impact of state MeSHD002017 cuts on MeSHD017664 at general acute care MeSHD006761 MeSHD009938. This study capitalized on the variations in the states of MeSHD013781 and MeSHD002140 to MeSHD020478 a natural experiment testing the MeSHD007596 impact of MeSHD002017 cut status on MeSHD017664 MeSHD003365, as well as specific MeSHD002608 care MeSHD003365 and bad debt expenses from MeSHD011203 MeSHD010361. MeSHD002017 cuts in the state of MeSHD013781 occurred in the year 2004. Information was obtained from the MeSHD013781 Department of MeSHD006262 and the MeSHD002140 Department of MeSHD006296 regarding financial characteristics of MeSHD006761 and from the American MeSHD006761 MeSHD016435 annual MeSHD011795 regarding organizational characteristics of MeSHD006761. We created three dependent variables: R(UC) (the ratio of total MeSHD017664 MeSHD003365 to gross MeSHD010361 revenue), R(CC) (the ratio of MeSHD002608 care to total MeSHD010361 revenue) and R(BD) (the ratio of bad debt expenses to gross MeSHD010361 revenue). Using a two-period panel MeSHD064886 and individual MeSHD006761 fixed effects, we captured MeSHD006761 MeSHD017664 spending that could also have influenced MeSHD002017 cut status. Additionally, the impact of the state MeSHD002017 cut status on MeSHD006761' MeSHD017664 spending, MeSHD002608 care spending and bad debt expenses was also estimated using the similar MeSHQ000379. POPULATION STUDIED: In this study, we included 416 (in MeSHD013781) and 352 (in MeSHD002140) public, not-for-profit (NFP) and for-profit (FP) MeSHD006761 that completed the annual MeSHD011795 during the study period 2002-2005. For the state of MeSHD013781, results from the fixed effect model confirmed that the year 2005 was directly related to increased R(UC) and R(CC) . The coefficients of 2005 were significantly and positively associated with R(UC) (0.43, p < 0.05) and R(CC) (0.29, p < 0.05). These results supported the MeSHQ000175 that the R(UC) and the R(CC) would be more positively associated with 2005 than any other year, with other things being equal. However, for the state of MeSHD002140, even though the coefficient of 2005 was significant and positively associated with R(CC) (0.31, p < 0.05), the coefficient of MeSHD017664 spending was not statistically significant for 2005. The MeSHD019981 is characterized by increased MeSHD012926, a growing number of MeSHD017057 MeSHD010361, increasingly stringent reimbursement and competitive practices among MeSHD006761 and other providers. Federal and state MeSHD003695 agencies are restricting the MeSHQ000592 for eligibility for outlier payments and MeSHD017664 provisions. MeSHD013660 exempt status of many NFP MeSHD006761 is being examined and tied to specific performances, particularly the provision of MeSHD017664. This study provides evidence of the impact of MeSHD002017 cut MeSHD011312 on MeSHD017664 provided in MeSHD013781 general acute care MeSHD006761.
22169081	The size of a MeSHD010865 for a MeSHD016430 should be calculated in relation to considerations of precision and MeSHD004526.	To investigate MeSHQ000379 to determine the size of a MeSHD010865 to inform a MeSHD011209 calculation for a MeSHD016449 (RCT) using an interval/ratio MeSHD017063. Calculations based on MeSHD016001 (CIs) for the sample standard deviation (SD). Based on CIs for the sample SD, MeSHQ000379 are demonstrated whereby (1) the observed SD can be adjusted to secure the desired level of statistical MeSHD011209 in the main study with a specified level of confidence; (2) the sample for the main study, if calculated using the observed SD, can be adjusted, again to obtain the desired level of statistical MeSHD011209 in the main study; (3) the MeSHD011209 of the main study can be calculated for the situation in which the SD in the MeSHD010865 proves to be an underestimate of the true SD; and (4) an "efficient" MeSHD000070356 size can be determined to minimize the combined size of the MeSHD000070356 and main RCT. Trialists should calculate the appropriate size of a MeSHD010865, just as they should the size of the main RCT, taking into account the MeSHD014427 MeSHD006301 to demonstrate MeSHD004526 in terms of recruitment and to produce precise estimates of MeSHQ000628 effect.
27177280	Uterine MeSHD012509: MeSHQ000032 of 13,089 Cases Based on MeSHQ000453, MeSHD004813, and End Results MeSHD019991.	The aim was to study the MeSHD015994 and MeSHD013534 of MeSHD010361 with uterine MeSHD012509 diagnosed in the period from 2000 to 2012 based on MeSHQ000453, MeSHD004813, and End Results (SEER) MeSHD019991. All 18 MeSHD012042 of the SEER MeSHD019991 were used to select cases. We included MeSHD014930 MeSHD000368 30 years or older diagnosed with uterine MeSHD012509. Histological subtypes were defined as MeSHD007890, MeSHD002296, stromal MeSHD012509, MeSHD018195, and MeSHD012509 not otherwise specified according to the 2003 MeSHD014944 MeSHD002965. Using SEER*Stat MeSHD012984 version 8.1.2. We calculated the age-adjusted MeSHD015994, extent of MeSHD004194 at MeSHD013995 of MeSHD003933, and MeSHD015996 with different MeSHQ000628 modalities for MeSHD044465, black, and other MeSHD044469. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards MeSHQ000032 were done to examine factors affecting MeSHD013534. We identified 13,089 MeSHD010361 diagnosed with uterine MeSHD012509 in the period from 2000 to 2012. The age-adjusted MeSHD015994 for MeSHD010361 MeSHD000368 50 years or older was more than that of younger MeSHD010361 (6.4/10 vs 1.5/10, P < 0.0001). Also, the age-adjusted MeSHD015994 for black MeSHD014930 was twice that of MeSHD044465 MeSHD014930 (7.3/10 vs 3.5/10, P < 0.0001). MeSHD002296 was the most commonly diagnosed subtype followed by MeSHD007890. MeSHD014930 MeSHD000368 50 years or older had worse MeSHD013534 than those younger than 50 years (hazard ratio, 1.78; 95% MeSHD016001, 1.64-1.92; P < 0.001). The MeSHD016424 MeSHD013534 of MeSHD010361 who had MeSHQ000601 with MeSHD011827 was better than those who had MeSHQ000601 alone (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% MeSHD016001, 0.83-0.95; P < 0.001). In MeSHD014930 with localized MeSHD004194, MeSHQ000601 was associated with better MeSHD013534 than MeSHQ000601 with MeSHD011827 (66.4% vs 74.4%, P < 0.00001). Uterine MeSHD012509 is an aggressive MeSHD009369 that occurs more in old age and among MeSHD014930 of black MeSHD044469. Poor MeSHD013534 was associated with old age, black MeSHD044469, and advanced MeSHD004194 stage. MeSHQ000532 in MeSHD010361 with localized stage does not improve the MeSHD013534.
17997202	Influence of clinical placement on undergraduate MeSHD008880 MeSHD013334' career MeSHD033182.	to explore the influence that clinical placements have on career MeSHD033182 for undergraduate MeSHD008880 MeSHD013334. a qualitative approach involving a combination of MeSHD017144 and individual MeSHD017203. the study was part of a larger study undertaken across a range of MeSHD006262 disciplines within one MeSHD014495. 11 Bachelor of MeSHD008880 MeSHD013334 who had either undertaken their first or last clinical placement. data were managed with QSR NVivo and MeSHQ000032 was influenced by the MeSHD014937 of Strauss and Corbin. Two main themes emerged: MeSHD008880 as a MeSHD002321 and MeSHD005544 MeSHD008880 career. MeSHQ000175 indicated that MeSHD013334 entered the course with preconceived ideas of MeSHD008880 and where they would practice after graduation. Clinical placements allowed MeSHD013334 to experience the reality of MeSHD008880 practice, promote identification with the profession, and influenced MeSHD003657 about MeSHD005544 careers. Finally, it raised limitations placed on diversity of available clinical experience. KEY CONCLUSIONS: clinical placements are essential for MeSHD008880 preparation. They challenge MeSHD013334' preconceived ideas about MeSHD008880 practice and assist them to develop perspectives on, and MeSHC029931 for, their MeSHD005544 careers. The diversity and quality of placement experience MeSHD010988 a significant MeSHD012380 in career MeSHD003657 and MeSHD004651 choices. positive placement experiences influence where MeSHD013334 MeSHD014836 choose to MeSHD014937 after graduation. These experiences can directly influence the organisations and clinical areas chosen by MeSHD013334 for graduate practice.
29304222	QUENTIN: reconstruction of MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000635 from MeSHD000074704 genomic data.	MeSHD009042: Genomic MeSHQ000032 has become one of the major tools for MeSHD004196 investigations. However, existing computational frameworks for inference of MeSHQ000635 MeSHQ000266 from viral genomic data often do not consider intra-host diversity of pathogens and heavily rely on additional epidemiological data, such as sampling MeSHD013995 and exposure intervals. This impedes genomic MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD004196 of highly mutable MeSHD014780 associated with MeSHD000088562, such as MeSHD006678 and MeSHD016174, whose MeSHQ000635 are often carried out through MeSHD033242 intra-host variants, while the additional epidemiological information often is either unavailable or has a limited MeSHQ000706. The proposed framework QUasispecies Evolution, Network-based MeSHQ000635 INference (QUENTIN) MeSHD019484 the above challenges by evolutionary MeSHQ000032 of intra-host viral MeSHD011153 sampled by MeSHD059014 and Bayesian inference using general properties of MeSHD060756 relevant to MeSHD007239 dissemination. This MeSHD008722 allows inference of MeSHQ000635 MeSHC029931 even without the supporting case-specific epidemiological information, identify MeSHQ000635 clusters and reconstruct MeSHQ000635 MeSHQ000266.

23013168	Integrating MeSHD016678 annotation and QTL position to identify candidate MeSHD005796 for MeSHD004526, MeSHD001108 and MeSHD014867-MeSHQ000706 MeSHD004526 in MeSHD032107 spp.	MeSHD002678 poplars species are candidates for MeSHD018533 MeSHD004467 but MeSHD001947 efforts are needed to combine MeSHD004526 and MeSHD014867 MeSHQ000706 MeSHD004526 in improved cultivars. The MeSHD032882 of the genetic MeSHD001108 of MeSHQ000254 in poplar by a MeSHD040641 (QTL) approach can help us to elucidate the molecular basis of such integrative traits but identifying candidate MeSHD005796 underlying these QTLs remains difficult. Nevertheless, the increase of genomic information together with the accessibility to a reference MeSHD016678 sequence (MeSHD032107 trichocarpa Nisqually-1) allow to bridge QTL information on genetic MeSHD019532 and physical location of candidate MeSHD005796 on the MeSHD016678. The objective of the study is to identify QTLs controlling MeSHD004526, MeSHD001108 and leaf traits in a P. deltoides x P. trichocarpa F1 progeny and to identify candidate MeSHD005796 underlying QTLs based on the anchoring of genetic MeSHD019532 on the MeSHD016678 and the MeSHD063990 information linked to MeSHD016678 annotation. The strategy to explore MeSHD016678 annotation was to MeSHQ000706 MeSHD063990 enrichment tools to test if some functional categories are statistically over-represented in QTL regions. Four leaf traits and 7 MeSHQ000254 traits were measured on 330 F1 P. deltoides x P. trichocarpa progeny. A total of 77 QTLs controlling 11 traits were identified explaining from 1.8 to 17.2% of the variation of traits. For 58 QTLs, MeSHD016001 could be projected on the MeSHD016678. An extended functional annotation was built based on data retrieved from the MeSHD018745 MeSHD019991 Phytozome and from an inference of MeSHQ000502 using homology between MeSHD032107 and the model MeSHD010944 MeSHD017360. MeSHD005796 located within QTL MeSHD016001 were retrieved and enrichments in MeSHD063990 (GO) terms were determined using different MeSHQ000379. Significant enrichments were found for all traits. Particularly relevant MeSHD001686 GO terms were identified for QTLs controlling number of sylleptic branches: intervals were enriched in GO terms of MeSHD001686 like 'ripening' and 'adventitious roots MeSHQ000254'. Beyond the simple identification of QTLs, this study is the first to MeSHQ000706 a global approach of GO terms enrichment MeSHQ000032 to fully explore MeSHD005796 MeSHQ000502 under QTLs MeSHD016001 in MeSHD010944. This global approach may MeSHD007854 to identification of new candidate MeSHD005796 for traits of interest.
23065787	A combined post-mortem MeSHD008279 and quantitative histological study of MeSHD009103 MeSHQ000473.	MeSHD009103 is a chronic inflammatory neurological condition characterized by focal and diffuse neurodegeneration and MeSHD003711 throughout the MeSHD002490. Factors influencing the progression of MeSHQ000473 are poorly understood. One hypothesis is that anatomical connectivity influences the spread of neurodegeneration. This predicts that MeSHD014894 of neurodegeneration MeSHD014836 correlate most strongly between interconnected structures. However, such patterns have been difficult to quantify through post-mortem MeSHD000069338 or in vivo scanning alone. In this study, we used the complementary approaches of whole MeSHD001921 post-mortem MeSHD008279 and quantitative MeSHQ000033 to assess patterns of MeSHD009103 MeSHQ000473. Two thalamo-cortical MeSHD011385 systems were considered based on their distinct MeSHD009445 and their documented involvement in MeSHD009103: MeSHD005829 to MeSHD000087642 and MeSHD020645 of the MeSHD013788 to MeSHD017397. Within the anatomically distinct thalamo-cortical MeSHD011385 systems, MeSHD008279 derived cortical thickness was correlated significantly with both a MeSHD014894 of myelination in the connected tract and a MeSHD014894 of connected thalamic nucleus MeSHD002452. Such correlations did not exist between these markers of neurodegeneration across different thalamo-cortical systems. MeSHD008279 lesion MeSHQ000032 depicted clearly demarcated subcortical lesions impinging on the MeSHD066127 tracts of interest; however, quantitation of the extent of lesion-tract overlap failed to demonstrate any appreciable MeSHD001244 with the severity of markers of diffuse MeSHQ000473 within each thalamo-cortical MeSHD011385 system. MeSHD004058-weighted MeSHD008279 MeSHD008795 in both MeSHD066127 tracts were correlated significantly with a histologically derived MeSHD014894 of tract myelination. These data demonstrate for the first MeSHD013995 the relevance of functional anatomical connectivity to the spread of MeSHD009103 MeSHQ000473 in a 'tract-specific' pattern. Furthermore, the persisting relationship between MeSHD008795 from post-mortem MeSHD004058-weighted MeSHD008279 and histological MeSHD014894 from fixed MeSHD014024 further validates the potential of imaging for MeSHD005544 neuropathological studies.
19502317	Description of MeSHC000641910 gen. nov., sp. nov., and reclassification of MeSHC000641911 Reddy et al. 2003 as MeSHC000641911 MeSHD003129. nov.	In the course of a study of the prokaryotic diversity of a MeSHD064091 site in Chandigarh, MeSHD007194, a MeSHD013180 designated SK 55(T) was isolated and characterized using a polyphasic approach. Its MeSHD012336 MeSHD005796 sequence showed closest similarity (98.3 %) to that of MeSHC000641911 CMS 21w(T). The sequence similarity to MeSHD013180 of other hitherto described species of MeSHD058644 was less than 95.5 %. MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) contains MeSHD010457 of the A4alpha type (l-Lys-d-MeSHD017819), MK-8 and MK-7 as the major MeSHD024482 and iso-C(15 : 0) as the major MeSHD005227. MeSHD013180 SK 55(T), MeSHC000641911 and MeSHC000639010, the type species of the genus, had some polar MeSHD008055 in common (MeSHD002308, MeSHD010715, MeSHC483858, a MeSHD010743 and an unknown MeSHD008055). However, an aminolipid, an aminophospholipid and an unknown MeSHD008055 found in the former two organisms are similar, though not identical, but quite different from the profile of S. ureae. The genomic MeSHD004247 MeSHD001482 of MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) (46.0 mol%) and S. macmurdoensis CMS 21w(T) (44.0 mol%) are higher than those reported for the majority of species of MeSHD058644 (36-42 mol%). As revealed by MeSHD012336 MeSHD005796 MeSHD017421, MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) and S. macmurdoensis CMS 21w(T) MeSHD020478 a clade which is distinct from the clade occupied by other species of MeSHD058644. On the basis of phenotypic characteristics including chemotaxonomic data and MeSHQ000032 of the MeSHD012336 MeSHD005796 sequence, we conclude that MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) should be considered as a member of a novel genus and species, for which the MeSHD009275 MeSHC000641910 gen. nov., sp. nov. is proposed. The type MeSHD013180 of MeSHC000641910 is SK 55(T) (=MTCC7604(T) =JCM 14041(T)). S. macmurdoensis CMS 21w(T) shows more similarity in its MeSHD012336 MeSHD005796 sequence (98.3 %), MeSHD004247 MeSHD001482 and polar MeSHD008055 profile to MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) than to S. ureae DSM 2281(T). Phylogenetically, it MeSHD020478 a coherent cluster with MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) which is separate from the MeSHD058644 cluster. Moreover, iso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(15 : 0) and C(16 : 1)omega7c alcohol are the three major MeSHD005227 in both S. macmurdoensis CMS 21w(T) and SK 55(T). All these data suggest that S. macmurdoensis should be a member of the genus Paenisporosarcina. However, S. macmurdoensis can be differentiated from SK 55(T) in several physiological and biochemical characteristics, especially in the patterns of oxidation and MeSHD000143 MeSHD004467 from MeSHD002241. The genomic relatedness of S. macmurdoensis CMS 21w(T) and MeSHD013180 SK 55(T) was also very low (18.0 %). It is therefore logical to transfer MeSHC000641911 to the newly created genus as MeSHC000641911 MeSHD003129. nov. The type MeSHD013180 is CMS 21w(T) (=MTCC4670(T) =DSM 15428(T)).
29655810	A MeSHD016454 of Interventions to Increase MeSHD016306 Retrieval Rates.	MeSHD016306 (IVCFs) are indicated for MeSHD013812 and prophylactic MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD054556 in MeSHD010361 when anticoagulation has failed or is contraindicated. Retrievable IVCFs are not always retrieved despite clinical recommendations. The purpose of this MeSHD016454 is to compare results in the MeSHD008091 regarding interventions and to improve IVCF retrieval rates. Articles were identified via the search terms "MeSHD016306" and "MeSHD016306" in conjunction with "retrieval." Searches were repeated in MeSHD016239/MeSHD039781, Google Scholar, and Cochrane MeSHD019991. Exclusion MeSHQ000592 included duplicates, misidentified subject matter, study period before 2008, and lack of MeSHD035061. Two independent reviewers screened key MeSHD004602 in the identified MeSHD020486, including the targeted intervention MeSHD011153, study design, IVCF retrieval rates, and other outcomes. A third reviewer corroborated results and consolidated MeSHQ000175. Seventeen articles were identified for MeSHD016454. Of these, 12 were MeSHD010820-targeted interventions, and 8 were MeSHD010361-targeted interventions (3 studies included both). IVCF retrieval rates varied substantially for each study, but all reviewed studies reported improvement in retrieval rate following intervention. Only 5 studies reported decreased IVCF indwell MeSHD013995 in intervention groups. Reported complication rates from IVCF retrievals were low, ranging from 0 to 2%. IVCF retrieval rates were improved by all interventions in the reviewed studies. MeSHQ000175 suggest that IVCF retrieval rates can be best improved by tracking MeSHD010361 typically MeSHD059012. MeSHD008091 suggests that successful tracking requires an individual or team of individuals who have been assigned dedicated clinical responsibility for coordinating care following IVCF placement.
18207447	Approaching the degradome in MeSHD054990.	MeSHD054990 (IPF) is a devastating, lethal and currently untreatable MeSHD008168 disorder of unknown MeSHQ000209. It is characterized by epithelial MeSHD014947 and activation, fibroblastic foci formation, and exaggerated accumulation of MeSHD005109 (ECM) with the destruction of the MeSHD008168 parenchyma. Despite important progress in our MeSHD032882 of the general mechanisms involved in MeSHD008168 fibrogenesis, the MeSHQ000209 of the IPF remains unclear. Although the irreversible and progressive MeSHD005355 in the MeSHD008168 suggests a decrease in MeSHD008168 degradative machinery, an increasing body of evidence, primarily obtained by global MeSHD015870 studies, demonstrates a significant MeSHD015854 of degrading MeSHD004798 in IPF. In this context, this MeSHD016454 MeSHD014836 focus on some MeSHD005190 of the degradome, a term proposed for the complete set of MeSHD010447 that are expressed at a specific MeSHD013995 by a MeSHD002477, MeSHD014024 or an organism. In particular, we MeSHD014836 approach recent progress in our MeSHD032882 of the MeSHD001519 of two MeSHD005190 of MeSHD045726 M10 and M12 which are significantly changed in the IPF MeSHD008168. In general, evidence highlights the increasing diversity in both substrates and MeSHQ000502 of these MeSHD004798 and the complexity of the processes in which they are involved, and indicate a critical MeSHD012380 in the abnormal remodeling of IPF.
20538609	The JmjN domain of Jhd2 is important for its MeSHD055550, and the MeSHD010944 homeodomain (PHD) MeSHD005385 mediates its MeSHD002843 MeSHD001244 independent of H3K4 MeSHD008745.	MeSHD006657 MeSHD008239 MeSHD008745 is a dynamic process that MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in regulating MeSHD002843 structure and MeSHD015870. Recent studies have identified Jhd2, a JmjC domain-containing MeSHD011506, as an H3K4-specific demethylase in MeSHD004718. However, important questions regarding the MeSHD012926 and MeSHQ000502 of Jhd2 remain unanswered. In this study, we show that Jhd2 has intrinsic activity to remove all three states of H3K4 MeSHD008745 in vivo and can dynamically associate with MeSHD002843 to modulate H3K4 MeSHD008745 levels on both active and repressed MeSHD005796 and at the telomeric regions. We found that the MeSHD010944 homeodomain (PHD) MeSHD005385 of Jhd2 is important for its MeSHD002843 MeSHD001244 in vivo. However, this MeSHD001244 is not dependent on H3K4 MeSHD008745 and the H3 N-terminal MeSHD013623, suggesting the presence of an alternative mechanism by which Jhd2 binds MeSHD009707. We also provide evidence that the JmjN domain and its interaction with the JmjC MeSHD020134 are important for Jhd2 MeSHQ000502 and that Not4 (an MeSHD044767) monitors the structural integrity of this interdomain interaction to maintain the MeSHD016424 MeSHD011506 levels of Jhd2. We show that the S451R MeSHD009154 in MeSHD006801 SMCX (a homolog of Jhd2), which has been linked to MeSHD008607, and the homologous T359R MeSHD009154 in Jhd2 MeSHD000339 the MeSHD055550 of both of these MeSHD011506. Therefore, our MeSHQ000175 provide a mechanistic explanation for the observed MeSHQ000002 in MeSHD010361 harboring this SMCX mutant and suggest the presence of a conserved pathway involving Not4 that modulates the MeSHD055550 of both MeSHD015003 Jhd2 and MeSHD006801 SMCX.
26753923	Barriers and facilitators to uptake of MeSHD000078182 by MeSHD000288 and MeSHD003695 managers: a scoping MeSHD016454.	We completed a scoping MeSHD016454 on the barriers and facilitators to MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD000078182 by MeSHD003695 managers and MeSHD000288, including consideration of format and content, to develop recommendations for MeSHD000078182 authors and to inform MeSHD012106 efforts to develop and test formats for MeSHD000078182 that may optimise their uptake. We used the Arksey and O'Malley approach for our scoping MeSHD016454. MeSHD004581 MeSHD019991 (e.g., MeSHD016239, EMBASE, PsycInfo) were searched from inception until September 2014. Any study that identified barriers or facilitators (including format and content features) to uptake of MeSHD000078182 by MeSHD003695 managers and MeSHD000288/analysts was eligible for inclusion. Two reviewers independently screened the MeSHD008091 results and abstracted data from the relevant studies. The identified barriers and facilitators were charted using a barriers and facilitators MeSHD002965 for implementing MeSHD017065 by clinicians. We identified useful information for authors of MeSHD000078182 to inform their preparation of MeSHD016454 including providing one-page summaries with key messages, tailored to the relevant audience. Moreover, partnerships between MeSHD012108 and MeSHD000288/managers to facilitate the conduct and MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD000078182 should be considered to enhance relevance of MeSHD016454 and thereby influence uptake. MeSHD000078182 authors can consider our results when MeSHD011643 their MeSHD000078182. These strategies should be rigorously evaluated to determine impact on MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD016454 in MeSHD003657.
19459700	Effects of MeSHD008372 and MeSHD014867 applications on MeSHC023891 and MeSHC100187 emissions in a field trial.	Minimizing fumigant emissions is required for meeting MeSHD000397 MeSHD012015. Application of organic materials to surface MeSHD012987 has been effective in reducing fumigant emissions during MeSHD007753 tests, but the potential to reduce emissions in the field has not been adequately evaluated. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of incorporated composted MeSHD008372 with or without MeSHD014867 applications on fumigant emissions and the potential impact on MeSHD010571 efficacy under field conditions. MeSHQ000628 included a bare-MeSHD012987 MeSHQ000517, composted dairy MeSHD008372 at 12.4 and 24.7 Mg ha(-1), postfumigation intermittent MeSHD014867 seals (11 mm MeSHD014867 irrigated immediately following MeSHD005651 and 4 mm at 12, 24, and 48 h), and incorporation of MeSHD008372 at 12.4 Mg ha(-1) combined with the MeSHD014867 seals or a MeSHD020959 (MeSHD020959) tarp. Telone C35 was shank-applied at 553 kg ha(-1), and emissions of MeSHC023891 (1,3-D) and MeSHC100187 (CP) were monitored for 10 days. The results indicate that there was no significant difference in emission peak flux and cumulative emission loss between the MeSHQ000517 and the 12.4 Mg ha(-1) MeSHD008372 MeSHQ000628. The higher MeSHD008372 rate (24.7 Mg ha(-1)) resulted in lower emission flux and cumulative emission loss than 12.4 Mg ha(-1), although the differences were only significant for CP. In contrast, the MeSHD018508 with or without MeSHD008372 incorporation significantly reduced peak emission rates (80% reduction) and cumulative emission loss ( approximately 50% reduction). The MeSHD008372 + MeSHD020959 MeSHQ000628 resulted in the lowest CP emissions but slightly higher 1,3-D emissions than the MeSHD018508. Reductions in peak emission from MeSHD018508 can be important in reducing the potential acute exposure MeSHD012306 to MeSHD009274 and bystanders. This MeSHD012106 demonstrated that incorporation of composted MeSHD008372 alone did not reduce fumigant emissions and effective emission reduction with MeSHD008372 amendment may require higher application rates and/or more effective materials than those used in this study.
28044459	Species-level identification of the MeSHD000086542 Chrysomya megacephala and other MeSHD004175 in MeSHD002681 by MeSHD004247 barcoding.	The MeSHD000086542 Chrysomya megacephala, or oriental MeSHD014038 MeSHD004175, is the most common MeSHD006801-associated MeSHD004175 of the oriental and Australasian regions. Chrysomya megacephala is of particular interest for its MeSHQ000706 in MeSHD000081230 and because it is a MeSHD004199. The MeSHD007814 are economically important as feed for MeSHD058751 and in MeSHD008516. Identification of MeSHD000328 is straightforward, but MeSHD007814 and fragments of MeSHD000328 are difficult to identify. We collected C. megacephala, its allies Chrysomya pinguis and Protophormia terraenovae, as well as MeSHD004175 from 11 other species from 52 locations around MeSHD002681, then sequenced 658 MeSHD020029 of the COI MeSHD001330 region from 645 MeSHD004175 of all 14 species, including 208 C. megacephala, as the basis of a COI MeSHD001330 MeSHD007990 for MeSHD004175 in MeSHD002681. While C. megacephala and its closest relative C. pinguis are closely related (mean K2P divergence of 0.022), these species are completely non-overlapping in their MeSHD001330 divergences, thus demonstrating the utility of the COI MeSHD001330 region for the identification of C. megacephala. We combined the 208 C. megacephala sequences from MeSHD002681 with 98 others from public MeSHD019991 and show that worldwide COI MeSHD001330 diversity is low, with 70% of all individuals belonging to one of three MeSHD006239 that differ by one or two substitutions from each other, reflecting recent anthropogenic dispersal from its native range in Eurasia.
20515600	BoTULS: a multicentre randomised controlled trial to evaluate the MeSHD016896 and MeSHD003362 of treating MeSHD034941 spasticity due to MeSHD020521 with MeSHD019274.	To compare the MeSHD016896 and MeSHD003362 of treating MeSHD034941 spasticity due to MeSHD020521 with MeSHD019274 plus an MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628 programme with the MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628 programme alone. A multicentre open-label parallel-group randomised controlled trial and MeSHD003362. Twelve MeSHD020521 services in the north of MeSHD004739, UK. Three hundred and thirty-three MeSHD000328 with MeSHD034941 spasticity at the MeSHD012782, MeSHD004550, MeSHD014953 or MeSHD006225 and reduced MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000502 due to MeSHD020521 more than 1 month previously. The intervention group received MeSHD019274 MeSHD007267(s) plus a 4-week programme of MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628. The MeSHD035061 received the MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628 programme alone. Participants were clinically reassessed at 3, 6 and 9 months to determine the need for repeat MeSHD019274 MeSHD007267(s) and/or MeSHQ000628. The primary outcome was MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000502 1 month after study entry measured by the MeSHD006302 MeSHD001132 Test (ARAT). A successful outcome was defined as: (1) a change of three or more points on the ARAT scale for a participant whose baseline ARAT score was between 0 and 3, (2) a change of six or more points on the ARAT scale for a participant whose baseline ARAT score was between 4 and 51, or (3) a final ARAT score of 57 for a participant whose baseline ARAT score was 52-56. MeSHD017063 were undertaken at 1, 3 and 12 months by an assessor who was blinded to the study group allocation. MeSHD034941 impairment and activity limitation were assessed by: Modified Ashworth Scale; Motricity MeSHD020481; MeSHD018737; ARAT; Nine-Hole Peg Test; MeSHD034941 basic functional activity questions and the Barthel MeSHD000203 (MeSHD000203) MeSHD020481. MeSHD020521-related MeSHD011788/participation restriction was measured using the MeSHD020521 Impact Scale, European MeSHD011788-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) and the Oxford Handicap Scale. MeSHD034941 MeSHD010146 was assessed using numerical rating MeSHD014894. Participant-selected MeSHD034941 MeSHD006040 MeSHD000124 (1 month only) was measured using the Canadian Occupational Performance MeSHD014894. Adverse events were compared. MeSHD003695 and MeSHD012947 MeSHD006295 MeSHQ000706 was compared during the first 3 months postrandomisation. EQ-5D data were used to calculate the MeSHD019057 (MeSHD019057) associated with intervention and MeSHQ000517 MeSHQ000628, and the incremental MeSHD003365 per QALY gained of MeSHD019274 plus MeSHQ000628 compared with MeSHQ000628 alone was estimated. The MeSHD012680 of the base-case results to alternative assumptions was investigated, and MeSHD003362 acceptability curves, which summarise the evidence of MeSHD019274 plus MeSHQ000628 being MeSHD003365-effective for a range of societal willingness to pay for a QALY values, are presented. Randomisation groups were well matched at baseline. There was no significant difference between the groups for the primary outcome of improved MeSHD001132 MeSHQ000502 at 1 month. This was achieved by 30/154 (19.5%) in the MeSHD035061 and 42/167 (25.1%) in the intervention group (p = 0.232). The MeSHD012306 of having a 'successful MeSHQ000628' in the intervention group compared with the MeSHD035061 was 1.3 [95% MeSHD016001 (CI) 0.9 to 2.0]. No significant differences in improved MeSHD001132 MeSHQ000502 were seen at 3 or 12 months. In terms of MeSHQ000556 outcomes, MeSHD009132 tone/spasticity at the MeSHD004550 was decreased in the intervention group compared with the MeSHD035061 at 1 month. The median change in the Modified Ashworth Scale was - 1 in the intervention group compared with zero in the MeSHD035061 (p < 0.001). No difference in spasticity was seen at 3 or 12 months. Participants treated with MeSHD019274 showed improvement in MeSHD034941 MeSHD053580 at 3 months. The mean change in strength from baseline (MeSHD034941 component of the Motricity MeSHD020481) was 3.5 (95% CI 0.1 to 6.8) points greater in the intervention group compared with the MeSHD035061. No differences were seen at 1 or 12 months. Participants in the intervention group were more likely to be able to undertake specific basic functional activities, e.g. dress a sleeve, clean the palm and open the MeSHD006225 for cutting MeSHD009262. At 1 month, 109/144 (75.7%) of the intervention group and 79/125 (63.2%) of the MeSHD035061 had improved by at least one point on a five-point Likert scale for at least one of these tasks (p = 0.033). At 3 months the corresponding proportions were 102/142 (71.8%) of the intervention group and 71/122 (58.2%) of the MeSHD035061 (p = 0.027). Improvement was sustained at 12 months for opening the MeSHD006225 for cleaning the palm and opening the MeSHD006225 for cutting the MeSHD009262 but not for other activities. MeSHD010146 rating improved by two points on a 10-point severity rating scale in the intervention group compared with zero points in the MeSHD035061 (p = 0.004) at 12 months, but no significant differences were seen at 1 or 3 months. There were a number of occasions when there were statistically significant differences in favour of the intervention group; however, these differences were small and of uncertain clinical relevance. These differences were: 3 months - MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000502 (change in ARAT score from baseline), MeSHD010146 (EQ-5D) and participation restriction (Oxford Handicap Scale); 12 months - MeSHD001007/MeSHD003863 (EQ-5D) and participation restriction (Oxford Handicap Scale). No differences in MeSHD018737, dexterity or the Barthel MeSHD000203 MeSHD020481 were found at any MeSHD013995 point. There were no differences between the groups for MeSHD000124 of MeSHD010361-selected MeSHD006040. There was a higher MeSHD015994 of general malaise/flu-like/MeSHD003080 MeSHQ000175 in participants treated with MeSHD019274 with a MeSHD012306 of 7.6 (95% CI 1.8 to 32.3). Only one serious adverse event (MeSHD003680) was potentially related to MeSHD019274. MeSHD013995 since MeSHD020521 and severity of initial MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000502 were preplanned subgroup analyses. There was no significant difference in either subgroup for MeSHD000124 of ARAT 'success' following MeSHQ000628 with MeSHD019274. The base-case incremental MeSHD003362 ratio was 93,500 pounds per QALY gained and estimation of the MeSHD003362 acceptability curve for MeSHD019274 plus the MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628 programme indicated that there was only a 0.36 MeSHD011336 of it being MeSHD003365-effective at a threshold ceiling ratio of 20,000 pounds per QALY. The addition of MeSHD019274 to an MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628 programme to treat spasticity due to MeSHD020521 did not enhance improvement in MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000502 when assessed by the prespecified primary MeSHD017063 at 1 month. However, improvements were seen in MeSHD009132 tone at 1 month, MeSHD034941 strength at 3 months, MeSHD034941 functional activities related to undertaking specific basic functional tasks at 1, 3 and 12 months, and MeSHD034941 MeSHD010146 at 12 months. MeSHD001905 was well tolerated and MeSHQ000009 were MeSHD033242. The addition of MeSHD019274 to an MeSHD034941 MeSHQ000628 programme for the MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD034941 spasticity due to MeSHD020521 was not estimated to be MeSHD003365-effective at levels of willingness to pay for a QALY set by NHS decision-makers.

29124835	Clinical characteristics and outcomes of MeSHD005871: A MeSHD016448 of 185 MeSHD044466 MeSHD010361.	MeSHD005871 (CD) is a rare MeSHD008232. To assess the clinical features, outcomes, and MeSHD011379 of this MeSHD004194, we retrospectively analyzed 185 MeSHD006678-negative CD MeSHD010361 from four medical centers in southern MeSHD002681. The median age was 37 years. One hundred and twenty-one MeSHD010361 (65.4%) were classified as unicentric CD (UCD) and 64 MeSHD010361 (34.6%) were classified as multicentric CD (MCD). The MeSHQ000033 subtype was MeSHD006818-vascular for 132 MeSHD010361 (71.4%), MeSHD010950 for 50 MeSHD010361 (27%), and mixed type for 3 MeSHD010361 (1.6%). The 5-year MeSHD016424 MeSHD013534 (OS) of 185 CD cases was 80.3%. All UCD MeSHD010361 underwent surgical excision, whereas the MeSHQ000628 strategies of MCD MeSHD010361 were heterogeneous. The outcome for UCD MeSHD010361 was better than MCD MeSHD010361, with 5-year OS rates of 93.6% and 51.2%, respectively. In further MeSHQ000032 of the MCD subgroup, a MeSHD015999 using a Cox regression model revealed that age, MeSHD013163 and pretreatment MeSHD012709 level were independent MeSHD011379 for OS. This MeSHD016448 comprising the largest MeSHD018401 to date suggested that MCD is a distinct entity from UCD with a significantly worse outcome. Older age (≥40 years), MeSHD013163, and MeSHD034141 were MeSHD012307 for poorer MCD MeSHD011379.
22116303	Preclinical evaluation of dual MeSHD019869-mTOR MeSHQ000037 and MeSHD056572 in MeSHD000077195.	We examine the potential value of a series of clinically relevant MeSHD019869-mTOR MeSHQ000037 alone, or in combination with MeSHD056572, in a model of MeSHD000077195 (MeSHD000077195). MeSHD000077195 MeSHD002460, MeSHD006801 MeSHD015603 and MeSHD000077195 MeSHD064593 models were treated with MeSHD056572 (HDACIs) and new generation MeSHD019869 and dual MeSHD019869-mTOR MeSHQ000037 either alone or in combination. MeSHD002477 and tumour MeSHD014022 and proliferation were then determined MeSHD066298 and in vivo. MeSHC055525 MeSHD010770, AKT and dual MeSHD019869-mTOR MeSHQ000037 caused marked MeSHD066298 enhancement of cytotoxicity induced by HDACIs in MeSHD000077195 MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477. This effect correlates with AKT inhibition and is attenuated by expression of constitutively active AKT. MeSHD056572 and MeSHC055525 MeSHD010770 MeSHQ000037 (PI3KIs) inhibited tumour MeSHQ000254 in MeSHD064593 models of MeSHD000077195. Importantly, we observed intratumoural HDAC inhibition and MeSHD019869 inhibition as assessed by MeSHD006657 MeSHD000107 status and phospho-AKT MeSHD013194, respectively. However, we saw no evidence of improved efficacy with an HDACI/PI3KI combination. That MeSHD019869 and dual MeSHD019869-mTOR MeSHQ000037 possess antitumour effect against MeSHD000077195 in vivo.
26311362	MLL MeSHD007938 induction by MeSHD000072669 of MeSHD006801 CD34+ hematopoietic MeSHD002477.	Chromosomal rearrangements involving the mixed-lineage MeSHD007938 (MLL) MeSHD005796 occur in primary and MeSHQ000628-related MeSHD007938 and MeSHC020416 a poor MeSHD011379. Studies based primarily on MeSHD051379 models have substantially advanced our MeSHD032882 of MLL MeSHD007938 MeSHQ000209, but often MeSHQ000706 supraphysiological MeSHD009857 expression with uncertain implications for MeSHD006801 MeSHD007938. MeSHD000072669 using site-specific nucleases provides a powerful new MeSHD013672 for MeSHD005796 modification to potentially model MeSHD006801 MeSHD004194, however, this approach has not been used to re-create acute MeSHD007938 in MeSHD006801 MeSHD002477 of origin comparable to MeSHD004194 observed in MeSHD010361. We applied MeSHD000071336 nuclease-mediated MeSHD000072669 to generate endogenous MLL-AF9 and MLL-ENL MeSHD009857 through MeSHD016254 in primary MeSHD006801 hematopoietic stem and MeSHD013234 (HSPCs) derived from MeSHD006801 MeSHD005312. Engineered HSPCs displayed altered MeSHD066298 MeSHQ000254 potentials and induced acute MeSHD007938 following MeSHQ000637 in immunocompromised MeSHD051379 at a mean latency of 16 weeks. The MeSHD007938 displayed phenotypic and morphologic similarities with MeSHD010361 MeSHD007938 blasts including a subset with mixed MeSHD010641, a distinctive feature seen in clinical MeSHD004194. The leukemic blasts expressed an MLL-associated transcriptional MeSHD019542 with elevated levels of crucial MLL target MeSHD005796, displayed heightened MeSHD012680 to DOT1L inhibition, and demonstrated increased oncogenic potential ex vivo and in MeSHQ000556 MeSHD019737 assays. Thus, MeSHD000072669 to create endogenous MLL MeSHD009857 in primary MeSHD006801 HSPCs faithfully models acute MLL-rearranged MeSHD007938 and provides an experimental platform for MeSHD011446 of MeSHD007938 initiation and MeSHD013234 MeSHD001695 in a genetic subtype of poor MeSHD011379 MeSHD007938.
18251855	MeSHD055432 MeSHD013672 and their application to the study of MeSHD010944 and MeSHD010944-host interactions.	MeSHD055432 is perhaps the ultimate level of post-genomic MeSHQ000032 as it can reveal changes in metabolite fluxes that are controlled by only MeSHD033242 changes within MeSHD015870 measured using transcriptomics and/or by analysing the MeSHD020543 that elucidates post-translational MeSHQ000517 over MeSHQ000201. Metabolic change is a major feature of MeSHD010944 genetic modification and MeSHD010944 interactions with pathogens, pests, and their MeSHD004777. In the assessment of MeSHD030821 MeSHD014024, MeSHD055432 has been used extensively to explore by-products resulting from MeSHD019076 expression and scenarios of substantial equivalence. Many studies have concentrated on the physiological MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD010944 MeSHD014024 as well as on the stress responses involved in MeSHD018869 or MeSHQ000628 with stress-eliciting molecules such as methyl MeSHC011006, MeSHD015003 elicitor or bacterial MeSHD008070. MeSHD010944-host interactions represent one of the most biochemically complex and challenging scenarios that are currently being assessed by MeSHD055432 approaches. For example, the mixtures of pathogen-colonised and non-challenged MeSHD059828 represent an extremely heterogeneous and biochemically rich sample; there is also the further complication of identifying which metabolites are derived from the MeSHD010944 host and which are from the interacting pathogen. This MeSHD016454 MeSHD014836 present an overview of the analytical MeSHQ000295 currently applied to MeSHD010944 MeSHD055432 MeSHQ000032, MeSHD008091 within the field MeSHD014836 be reviewed paying particular regard to studies based on MeSHD010944-host interactions and finally the MeSHD005544 prospects on the MeSHD055432 MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD010944 and MeSHD010944-host interactions MeSHD014836 be discussed.
29394417	MeSHD001244 MeSHQ000032 Identifies New MeSHD012306 Loci for MeSHD003031 MeSHD009274' MeSHD011009 in Han MeSHD044466 MeSHD008571.	MeSHD055008 (CWP) is a debilitating and progressive occupational MeSHD008171 resulted from long-term MeSHD001239 of airborne MeSHD012822-containing MeSHD003031 mine MeSHD004391. Both environmental factors and MeSHD014644 contribute to CWP. Our previous MeSHD055106 (GWAS) revealed a tiny fraction of variants with the top MeSHD001244 in MeSHD044466 Han MeSHD011153. To identify novel susceptibility loci of CWP, functional variants with suboptimal MeSHD001244 in the GWAS scan were further studied here. Imputation was firstly performed to access the MeSHD001244 between ungenotyped variants and CWP MeSHD012306, and suboptimal MeSHD001244 with p < 1.0 × 10-3 were annotated with MeSHD005838-MeSHD014024 expression (GTEx) and dbNSFP. Further, expression MeSHD040641 (eQTL) and nonsynonymous variants were validated within an independent cohort with 703 CWP cases and 705 exposed MeSHQ000517. Comprehensively functional annotations were performed for identified MeSHD020641 (MeSHD020641) based on multiple MeSHD019295 MeSHD019991 and websites. We found 4 CWP MeSHD012306-associated eQTL MeSHD020641, including rs10797062 at 1q23.2 (p = 6.91 × 10-4, OR = 1.28), rs1667614 at 2q13.1 (p = 1.48 × 10-4, OR = 0.53), rs2540438 at 2q33.1 (p = 2.13 × 10-3, OR = 1.33), and rs2274554 at 13q31.1 (p = 9.01 × 10-5, OR = 1.35). Based on the results from GTEx, the identified variants were significantly associated with host MeSHD005796 in MeSHD008168 MeSHD014024: rs10797062-ATP1A4 (p = 8.60 × 10-11), rs1667614-FNBP1P1 (p = 1.00 × 10-20), rs2540438-ALS2CR12 (p = 1.90 × 10-7), and rs2274554-RBM26 (p = 5.00 × 10-6). MeSHD007596 effect MeSHQ000032 showed the MeSHD012306 of CWP was significantly increased with the number of MeSHD012306 variant MeSHD000483 in an MeSHD000483-dosage manner (ptrend = 2.20 × 10-12). Enrichment pathway MeSHQ000032 suggested coexpressed MeSHD005796 of ATP1A4, FNBP1P1, and RBM26 were enriched in MeSHD025801 mediated MeSHD059748 pathway simultaneously. These results may provide a deeper MeSHD032882 of the MeSHD020022 of CWP.
25723325	Preliminary estimation of MeSHC007262 excretion through a 24 h MeSHD010865.	A duplicate MeSHD004032 study was designed to explore the MeSHQ000453 of 15 MeSHD005670 MeSHD009183 in the 24 h-MeSHD004032 consumed by one MeSHD014838 as well as the levels of MeSHD009183 in his 24 h-collected MeSHQ000652. The employed MeSHQ000379 involved MeSHD012997 extraction at high MeSHD009994 followed by dispersive MeSHD052616 and MeSHD002849 MeSHQ000032 coupled to MeSHD013058 in tandem. Satisfactory results in MeSHD008722 performance were achieved. The MeSHD008722's accuracy was in a range of 68%-108%, with intra-day relative standard deviation and inter-day relative standard deviation lower than 12% and 15%, respectively. The limits of quantitation ranged from 0.1 to 8 µg/Kg. The matrix effect was evaluated and matrix-matched MeSHD002138 were used for quantitation. Only MeSHC007262 (DON) was quantified in both MeSHD005502 and MeSHQ000652 samples. A total DON daily intake amounted to 49.2 ± 5.6 µg whereas DON daily excretion of 35.2 ± 4.3 µg was determined. DON daily intake represented 68.3% of the established DON provisional maximum MeSHD019055 (PMTDI). Valuable preliminary information was obtained as regards DON excretion and MeSHD006301 to be confirmed in large-scale monitoring studies.
28962325	Prohexadione, a MeSHD010937, inhibits MeSHD056466 and modulates MeSHD057890.	MeSHD057890 modifications, particularly MeSHD019175 and posttranslational MeSHD042421 regulate heritable changes in transcription without changes in the MeSHD001483. Despite a number of studies showing clear links between environmental factors and MeSHD019175, little is known about the effect of environmental factors on the recently identified MeSHD006657 MeSHD008239 MeSHD008745. Since their identification numerous studies have establish critical MeSHD012380 played by these MeSHD004798 in mammalian MeSHQ000254. Identification of the Jumonji (Jmj) domain containing MeSHD056466 have added a new dimension to MeSHD057890 MeSHQ000517 of MeSHD015870 by dynamic MeSHD012926 of MeSHD006657 MeSHD008745 marks. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of prohexadione and MeSHC478126, widely used MeSHD010937 of the acylcyclohexanediones class, on the enzymatic activity of MeSHD056466 and MeSHD042421 during the neural stem/MeSHD013234 differentiation. Here we show that prohexadione, but not MeSHC478126, directly inhibits non-MeSHD006418 MeSHD007501 (II), MeSHD007656-dependent MeSHD056466 such as Jmjd2a. We used molecular modeling to show binding of prohexadione to Jmjd2a. We also performed MeSHD066298 MeSHD000073398 assays to show the inhibitory effect of prohexadione on Jmjd2a. Further we tested this molecule in MeSHD018929 model of MeSHD051379 hippocampal neural stem/MeSHD013234 to demonstrate its effect toward neuronal proliferation and differentiation. Molecular modeling studies suggest that prohexadione binds to the MeSHD007656 MeSHD001665 of Jmjd2a demethylase. MeSHQ000628 of primary neural stem/MeSHD013234 with prohexadione showed a concentration dependent reduction in their proliferation. Further, the prohexadione treated neurospheres were induced toward neurogenic lineage upon differentiation. Our results describe an important chemico-MeSHD001688 interaction of prohexadione, in MeSHD008027 of critical MeSHD012380 played by MeSHD056466 in MeSHD006801 MeSHD006262 and MeSHD004194.
19562473	An integrated model of legal and moral reasoning and rule-violating MeSHD001519: the MeSHD012380 of legal MeSHD001290.	Legal MeSHD012951 theory predicts that MeSHD001290 mediate the relation between legal reasoning and rule-violating MeSHD001519 [Cohn, E. S., & MeSHD044465, S. O. (1990). Legal MeSHD012951: A Study of Norms and Rules. MeSHD009518: Springer-Verlag]. MeSHD035863 theory predicts that moral reasoning predicts rule-violating MeSHD001519 directly as well as indirectly [Blasi, A. (1980). Bridging moral MeSHD003071 and moral action: A critical MeSHD016454 of the MeSHD008091. Psychological Bulletin, 88, 1-45]. We present and test an integrated model of rule-violating MeSHD001519 MeSHD020472 on both theories in a MeSHD008137 of middle MeSHD012574 and high MeSHD012574 MeSHD013334. MeSHD013334 completed MeSHD011795 three MeSHD013995 during the course of 1 year at 6-month intervals. Legal and moral reasoning, legal MeSHD001290, and rule-violating MeSHD001519 were measured at MeSHD013995 one, two, and three respectively. Structural equation models revealed that while moral and legal reasoning were directly and indirectly related to rule-violating MeSHD001519 among high MeSHD012574 MeSHD013334, legal reasoning bore no direct relation to rule-violating MeSHD001519 among middle MeSHD012574 MeSHD013334. The implications for an integrated model of reasoning and rule-violating MeSHD001519 are discussed.
28732048	MeSHD020577 and MeSHD003716 MeSHD007239 in the MeSHD009033 MeSHD000330 fluviatilis (MeSHD004175: MeSHD009033).	MeSHD003715 represents a serious threat to MeSHD006801 MeSHD006262, with billions of people living at MeSHD012306 of the MeSHD004194. MeSHC000638514 is a bacterial endosymbiont common to many MeSHD007313 species. MeSHD020577 transinfections in MeSHD009033 MeSHD004199 have great value for MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000517 given the bacterium's MeSHD001076 to spread into wild MeSHD009033 MeSHD011153, and to interfere with MeSHD007239 of pathogens, such as MeSHD003716. MeSHD000330 fluviatilis is a MeSHD009033 with a widespread MeSHQ000600 in MeSHD007843, but its status as a MeSHD003715 vector has not been clarified. Ae. fluviatilis is also naturally infected by the wFlu MeSHD020577 MeSHD013180, which has been demonstrated to enhance MeSHD007239 with the avian malarial MeSHD010271 MeSHD010964. We performed experimental MeSHD007239 of Ae. fluviatilis with DENV-2 and DENV-3 isolates from MeSHD001938 via MeSHD007267 or oral feeding to provide insight into its MeSHD016743 for the MeSHD014780. We also examined the effect of the native MeSHD020577 MeSHD007239 on the MeSHD014780 using a MeSHD009033 line where the wFlu MeSHD007239 had been cleared by MeSHD000900 MeSHQ000628. Through RT-qPCR, we observed that Ae. fluviatilis could become infected with both MeSHD014780 via either MeSHD008722 of MeSHD007239, although at a lower rate than MeSHD000330 aegypti, the primary MeSHD003715 vector. We then detected DENV-2 and DENV-3 in the MeSHD012463 of injected MeSHD009033, and observed that MeSHD007267 of DENV-3-infected MeSHD012463 produced subsequent MeSHD007239 in naïve Ae. aegypti. However, across our data we observed no difference in MeSHQ000453 of MeSHD007239 and MeSHD019562 between MeSHD020577-infected and -uninfected MeSHD009033, suggesting that there is no effect of wFlu on MeSHD003716. Our results highlight that Ae. fluviatilis could potentially serve as a MeSHD003715 vector under the right circumstances, although further testing is required to determine if this occurs in the field.
25934360	MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000628 and replication stress: forks on the road to perdition.	Deregulated MeSHD004261 occurs in MeSHD009369 where it contributes to MeSHD042822. This process is a target of cytotoxic MeSHQ000628. MeSHD004358 exploit high MeSHD004261 in MeSHD009369 MeSHD002477 by modifying the MeSHD004247 template or by inhibiting vital enzymatic activities that MeSHD007854 to slowing or stalling replication fork progression. Stalled replication forks can be converted into toxic MeSHD004247 double-strand breaks resulting in MeSHD016923, i.e., replication stress. While likely crucial for many MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000628, replication stress is poorly understood due to its complexity. While we still know relatively little about the MeSHD012380 of replication stress in MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000628, technical advances in recent years have shed new MeSHD008027 on the effect that MeSHD009369 MeSHD013812 have on replication forks and the molecular mechanisms that MeSHD007854 from obstructed fork progression to MeSHD016923. This chapter MeSHD014836 give an overview of our current MeSHD032882 of replication stress in the context of MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000628.
29483077	Reducing MeSHD012306 of MeSHD003924 after MeSHD016640: a qualitative study to explore the potential of MeSHD013672 in MeSHD011320.	Despite the seven-fold increased MeSHD012306 of MeSHD003924 (T2DM) among MeSHD005260 previously diagnosed with MeSHD016640 (GD), annual rates of follow-up in MeSHD011320 are low. There is a need to consider how to reduce the MeSHD015994 of progression to T2DM among this high-MeSHD012306 group. To examine the views of MeSHD005260 diagnosed with GD to ascertain how to improve MeSHD011320 support postnatally, and the potential MeSHD012380 of MeSHD013672 in reducing the MeSHD012306 of progression to T2DM. A qualitative study of a purposive sample of 27 postnatal MeSHD005260 leaving MeSHD063127 with a recent MeSHD003933 of GD. Semi-structured MeSHD017203 were conducted with 27 MeSHD005260, who had been previously diagnosed with GD, at around 6-12 weeks postnatally. MeSHD017203 were audiotaped, transcribed, and analysed thematically. Facilitators and barriers to engaging in a healthy postnatal MeSHD008019 were identified, the most dominant being competing demands on MeSHD013995. Although MeSHD005260 were generally satisfied with the MeSHD063127 they received antenatally, they felt abandoned postnatally and were uncertain what to expect from their GP in terms of follow-up and support. MeSHD005260 felt MeSHD011181 could be improved by greater clarity regarding this, and enhanced by peer support, multidisciplinary input, and subsidised facilities. MeSHD013672 was seen as a potential adjunct by providing information, enabling flexible and personalised MeSHD000073278, and facilitating MeSHD012944. A more tailored approach for MeSHD005260 previously diagnosed with GD may help reduce the MeSHD012306 of progression to T2DM. A need for MeSHD005544 MeSHD012106 to test the efficacy of using MeSHD013672 as an adjunct to current care was identified.
22952422	MeSHD054377α mediates resistance to mTOR-directed MeSHQ000628 in MeSHD010190.	The factors preventing the translation of preclinical MeSHQ000175 supporting the clinical MeSHQ000254 mTOR-targeted MeSHQ000628 in MeSHD010190 MeSHQ000628 remain undetermined. MeSHD017154.derived factor 1α (SDF-1α)-CXCR4 signaling was examined as a representative microenvironmental factor able to promote mTOR-targeted MeSHQ000628 resistance in MeSHD010190. Primary MeSHD010179 explant MeSHD064593 and MeSHD066298 experiments were used to perform pharmacodynamic analyses of SDF-1α-CXCR4 MeSHD012926 of the mTOR pathway. Combinatorial effects of CXCR4, EGFR, and mTOR pharmacologic inhibition were evaluated in MeSHC401859-resistant and -sensitive MeSHD064593. Intratumoral MeSHD005796 and MeSHD011506 expressions of mTOR pathway effectors MeSHD019938, c-Myc, and MeSHD042461 were evaluated. Baseline intratumoral SDF-1α MeSHD015870 correlated with MeSHC401859 resistance in explant models. SDF-1α stimulation of pancreatic MeSHD002477 resulted in CXCR4-mediated MeSHD019869-dependent MeSHC012008-RP MeSHD010766 (pS6-RP) on exposure to MeSHC401859. Combinatorial MeSHQ000628 with MeSHC503590 (CXCR4 small-molecule inhibitor) and MeSHC401859 resulted in effective MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 inhibition to overcome MeSHC401859 resistance. In contrast, SDF-1α exposure induced a MeSHC401859-resistant MeSHD010641 in MeSHC401859-sensitive explants. MeSHC503590 inhibited CXCR4-mediated intratumoral MeSHC012008-RP MeSHD010766 and MeSHD056741 and MeSHD016259 expression. Next, CXCR4 promoted intratumoral EGFR expression in MeSHD001244 with MeSHC401859 resistance. MeSHQ000628 with MeSHC503590, MeSHC401859- and MeSHD000069347-mediated MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254 inhibition to overcome MeSHC401859 resistance in the explant model. Lastly, SDF-1α-CXCR4 signaling increased intratumoral MeSHD042461 MeSHD005796 and MeSHD011506 expression. SDF-1α-CXCR4 signaling represents a microenvironmental factor that can maintain mTOR pathway fidelity to promote resistance to mTOR-targeted MeSHQ000628 in MeSHD010190 by a variety of mechanisms such as recruitment of EGFR signaling and angiogenesis.
25064606	The MeSHD012380 of PfEMP1 adhesion domain MeSHD002965 in MeSHD010963 MeSHQ000209 MeSHD012106.	The MeSHD010963 MeSHD004910 MeSHD011506 1 (PfEMP1) MeSHD005190 has a key MeSHD012380 in MeSHD010271 MeSHD013534, MeSHQ000635, and MeSHQ000472. PfEMP1 are exported to the MeSHD004910 and mediate binding of infected MeSHD004912 to the endothelial lining of MeSHD001808. This process aids MeSHD010271 MeSHD013534 by avoiding MeSHD013154-dependent MeSHD006708 mechanisms, but it is associated with adhesion-based MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000150. Switching between PfEMP1 MeSHD011506 enables MeSHQ000469 to evade host MeSHD007109 and modifies MeSHD010271 MeSHD018523 for different microvascular MeSHD001513. The PfEMP1 MeSHD011506 MeSHD005190 is one of the most diverse adhesion modules in MeSHD019368. This MeSHD016454 covers PfEMP1 adhesion domain MeSHD002965 and the significant MeSHD012380 it is playing in deciphering and deconvoluting P. falciparum cytoadhesion and MeSHD004194.
22020510	Modular MeSHD004738 of MeSHD014443 MeSHD004467 in MeSHD004926.	Efficient MeSHQ000096 of MeSHD014443 from MeSHD005947 is necessary to make MeSHD001688 MeSHD004467 economically viable. To this end, we designed and constructed a modular MeSHD053898 for MeSHD014443 MeSHD004467 in E. coli MG1655 by encoding the MeSHD004798 for converting MeSHC026959 (E4P) and MeSHD010728 (PEP) to MeSHD014443 on two MeSHD010957. Rational MeSHD004738 to improve MeSHD014443 MeSHD004467 and to identify pathway bottlenecks was directed by targeted MeSHD040901 and metabolite profiling. The bottlenecks in the pathway were relieved by modifications in MeSHD010957 copy numbers, promoter strength, MeSHD005796 MeSHD000081183, and the placement of MeSHD005796 in MeSHD009876. One major bottleneck was due to the bifunctional activities of MeSHD011801/MeSHC022641 (YdiB), which caused accumulation of the intermediates dehydroquinate (DHQ) and dehydroshikimate (DHS) and the side product MeSHD011801; this bottleneck was relieved by replacing YdiB with its paralog AroE, resulting in the MeSHD004467 of over 700 mg/liter of shikimate. Another bottleneck in shikimate MeSHD004467, due to low expression of the dehydroquinate synthase (AroB), was alleviated by optimizing the first 15 MeSHD003062 of the MeSHD005796. Shikimate conversion to MeSHD014443 was improved by replacing the MeSHC022642 AroK with its MeSHD007527, AroL, which effectively consumed all intermediates formed in the first half of the pathway. Guided by the MeSHD011506 and metabolite measurements, the best producer, consisting of two medium-copy-number, dual-MeSHD009876 MeSHD010957, was optimized to produce >2 g/liter MeSHD014443 at 80% of the theoretical yield. This MeSHD014937 demonstrates the utility of targeted MeSHD040901 and metabolite profiling in pathway construction and optimization, which should be applicable to other MeSHD053858.
27307635	CMsearch: simultaneous exploration of MeSHD011506 sequence space and structure space improves not only MeSHD011506 homology detection but also MeSHD011506 structure prediction.	MeSHD011506 homology detection, a fundamental problem in MeSHD019295, is an indispensable step toward predicting MeSHD011506 structures and MeSHD032882 MeSHD011506 MeSHQ000502. Despite the advances in recent decades on MeSHD016415, threading and alignment-free MeSHQ000379, MeSHD011506 homology detection remains a challenging open problem. Recently, network MeSHQ000379 that try to find transitive paths in the MeSHD011506 structure space demonstrate the importance of incorporating network information of the structure space. Yet, current MeSHQ000379 merge the sequence space and the structure space into a single space, and thus introduce inconsistency in combining different sources of information. We present a novel network-based MeSHD011506 homology detection MeSHD008722, CMsearch, based on cross-modal MeSHD007858. Instead of exploring a single network built from the mixture of sequence and structure space information, CMsearch builds two separate networks to represent the sequence space and the structure space. It then learns sequence-structure correlation by simultaneously taking sequence information, structure information, sequence space information and structure space information into consideration. We tested CMsearch on two challenging tasks, MeSHD011506 homology detection and MeSHD011506 structure prediction, by querying all 8332 PDB40 MeSHD011506. Our results demonstrate that CMsearch is insensitive to the similarity MeSHD008795 used to define the sequence and the structure spaces. By using HMM-HMM alignment as the sequence similarity MeSHD008795, CMsearch clearly outperforms state-of-the-MeSHD001154 homology detection MeSHQ000379 and the CASP-winning template-based MeSHD011506 structure prediction MeSHQ000379.

24601953	Facilitating MeSHD019359 of MeSHD008603 MeSHD009726 to undertake physical MeSHD006262 interventions: a pre-test/post-test evaluation.	The aim of this project was to develop and deliver an evidence-based educational package with a physical and MeSHD008603 focus to clinicians and other MeSHD003695 MeSHD009274 in MeSHD008603 settings. For individuals who experience MeSHD001523, MeSHD004358 is often considered as a first line of MeSHQ000628. However, owing to MeSHD064420 and pre-existing physical conditions, outcomes for MeSHD010361/service users may be compromised. MeSHD009026 and MeSHD009017 rates of people diagnosed with a serious MeSHD001523 caused by physical MeSHD006262 conditions do not compare favourably with the general MeSHD011153. This MeSHD010209 MeSHD058028 on a physical skills project that was developed in collaboration between the MeSHD014495 of Huddersfield and South West Yorkshire Partnership MeSHD005582 MeSHD035502. Pre-post study design: five MeSHD004493 were conducted in the fields of MeSHD007273, diabetes, MeSHD006262 improvement, MeSHD009909 and MeSHD014947 care. A total of 180 pairs of MeSHD011795 to assess practitioner and MeSHD013334 skills and MeSHD019359 were administered to participants before and after MeSHD004493. All MeSHD004493 resulted in a statistically significant improvement in subject skills and MeSHD019359 scores (P < 0.001 in all cases). MeSHD011795 also elicited participant MeSHD010549 with the MeSHD004493: over 99% of participants reported being 'satisfied' or 'very satisfied' with the MeSHD004493. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: MeSHD008603 MeSHD009726 are the largest group of registered practitioners working in the MeSHD008603 setting and thus need to be harnessed to make a positive contribution to the improvement of the physical MeSHD006304 of service users with a serious MeSHD001523.
21673361	Gut clock: implication of MeSHD002940 in the MeSHD041981.	Circadian and seasonal rhythms are a fundamental feature of all living organisms and their MeSHD015388. MeSHD010507 are responsible for daily MeSHD004435; the period of MeSHD006815 and satiety is controlled by the central pacemaker, which resides in the MeSHD013493 (SCN) of the MeSHD007031, and communicates with MeSHD014024 via bidirectional neuronal and humoral pathways. The molecular basis for circadian timing in the MeSHD041981 (GIT) involves interlocking transcriptional/translational MeSHD005246 loops which culminate in the rhythmic expression and activity of a set of clock MeSHD005796 and related MeSHD006728. Interestingly, it has been found that clocks in the GIT are responsible for the periodic activity (PA) of its various segments and transit along the GIT; they are localized in special interstitial MeSHD002477, with unstable MeSHD008564 located between the longitudinal and circular MeSHD009132 layers. The rhythm of slow waves is controlled in various segments of the GIT: in the MeSHD013270 (about 3 cycles per min), in the MeSHD004386 (12 cycle per min), in the MeSHD007583 and MeSHD007082 (from 7 to 10 cycles per min), and in the MeSHD003106 (12 cycles per min). The MeSHD016065 (MMC) starts in the MeSHD013270 and moves along the gut causing peristaltic contractions when the electrical activity spikes are superimposed on the slow waves. GIT MeSHD006728, such as MeSHD009037 and MeSHD054439, are involved in the generation of MMCs, while others (MeSHD005755, MeSHD054439, MeSHD002766, MeSHD012701) are involved in the generation of spikes upon the slow waves, resulting in peristaltic or segmental contractions in the small (MeSHD004386, MeSHD007583 MeSHD007082) and large bowel (MeSHD003106). Additionally, MeSHD008550, produced by neuro-MeSHD055098 of the GIT MeSHD009092, MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in the internal MeSHD001683, related to MeSHD004435 (MeSHD006815 and satiety) and the myoelectric rhythm (produced primarily by the MeSHD010870 during the dark period of the MeSHD017440). This appears to be an endocrine encoding of the environmental MeSHD017440, conveying photic information which is used by organisms for both circadian and seasonal MeSHD009938. Motor and secretory activity, as well as the rhythm of MeSHD049109 in the GIT and MeSHD008099, are subject to many MeSHD002940, mediated by autonomic MeSHD002477 and some enterohormones (MeSHD005755, MeSHD054439 and MeSHD013004). Disruption of circadian MeSHQ000502, due to MeSHD012890 disturbance or shift MeSHD014937, may result in various MeSHD005767, such as MeSHD043183 (IBS), MeSHD005764 (MeSHD005764) or MeSHD010437 MeSHD004194. In addition, circadian disruption accelerates MeSHD000375, and promotes MeSHD063646 in the MeSHD008099 and GIT. Identification of the molecular basis and MeSHD012380 of MeSHD008550 in the MeSHD012926 of MeSHD002940 allows MeSHD012108 and clinicians to approach MeSHD005767 from a chronobiological perspective. MeSHD000068397 have demonstrated that the MeSHD009934 of MeSHD008550 improves MeSHQ000175 in MeSHD010361 with IBS and MeSHD005764. Moreover, our own studies indicate that MeSHD008550 significantly protects gastrointestinal MeSHD009092, and has strong protective effects on the MeSHD008099 in MeSHD010361 with non-MeSHD005235 (NASH). Recently, it has been postulated that disruption of circadian MeSHD012926 may MeSHD007854 to MeSHD009765 by shifting MeSHD004435 MeSHD001071. MeSHD005544 MeSHD012106 should focus on the MeSHD012380 of clock MeSHD005796 in the MeSHQ000503 of the GIT and MeSHD008099.
26190708	Severe MeSHD007003 associated with MeSHD007335-producing MeSHD008099 MeSHD009362 from gastric MeSHD002277 treated with overnight MeSHD010289 via a central MeSHD014680 MeSHD057785 reserve port.	MeSHD007003 caused by MeSHD007335 is difficult to MeSHQ000517. A 77-year-old MeSHD014930 was diagnosed with MeSHD013274 and multiple MeSHD008099 MeSHD009362 in September 2006 and underwent MeSHD004358; however, at that MeSHD013995 there were no MeSHQ000175 of MeSHD007003. From January 2007 onwards, MeSHD007004 MeSHD003128 and MeSHQ000175 of MeSHD007003 began to appear frequently. Her MeSHD044967 level of MeSHD007328 was normal; thus, we suspected the presence of MeSHC066038 was causing the MeSHD007003. This was proven by MeSHD015153 and we diagnosed non-MeSHD007516 MeSHD007003 associated with MeSHD013274. Overnight nutrition provided via a MeSHD062905 port to prevent MeSHD007003 allowed the MeSHD010361 to become ambulant and to remain free of MeSHD007004 MeSHD003128 at follow-up until her MeSHD003643 7 months later.
27242236	MeSHQ000628 of severe refractory MeSHD004893 leprosum with MeSHD000079424 MeSHD000068800.	MeSHD004893 leprosum (ENL) is a common complication of MeSHD015440. Some MeSHD010361 unresponsive to conventional, first-line MeSHD013812 develop recurrent, recalcitrant ENL. Here, we MeSHD058028 a case of severe refractory ENL that was successfully treated with MeSHD000068800. MeSHD001688 may be considered as MeSHD013812 alternatives in management of severe, recalcitrant ENL.
19383102	Possible MeSHD012380 of early flowering 3 (ELF3) in clock-dependent floral MeSHD012926 by short vegetative phase (SVP) in MeSHD017360.	MeSHD057906 MeSHD011506 MeSHD010988 key MeSHD012380 in adaptations of MeSHD010944 to diurnal environmental conditions. The photoperiodic flowering response is one of the mechanisms of adaptation to seasonal changes in the lengths of day and night. Double MeSHD009154 in two clock MeSHD005796, late elongated MeSHD018546 (LHY) and MeSHD057906 associated 1 (CCA1), accelerated flowering under short days (SDs) but delayed flowering under continuous MeSHD008027 (LL) in MeSHD017360. The mechanism underlying the late flowering of lhy;cca1 mutants under LL was investigated here. Late flowering of MeSHD010944 with overexpression of short vegetative phase (SVP) was much more pronounced under SDs and enhanced by constans 2 (co-2) under long days (LDs), suggesting that SVP and MeSHD002248 act independently in the photoperiodic flowering pathway. However, how SVP and flowering locus C (FLC) mediated the effects of LHY/CCA1 and thus influenced flowering MeSHD013995 was not completely clear. A mutant line lhy;cca1 in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) background was established, MeSHD005020 (EMS)-mutagenized and used to screen suppressors of late flowering of lhy;cca1 under LL. MeSHD009154 in the clock MeSHD005796 early flowering 3 (ELF3) were identified as suppressors. Overexpression and loss-of-MeSHQ000502 of ELF3 influenced SVP MeSHD011506 accumulation. Therefore, we propose that, as well as the classical GIGANTEA (GI)-MeSHD002248 pathway, LHY/CCA1 regulates a pathway negatively controlling flowering locus T (FT), possibly via ELF3-SVP/FLC.
18650055	Potential MeSHD012380 of MeSHD043562 30 (GPR30) in MeSHD004958-stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression in bovine satellite MeSHD018929.	Androgenic and estrogenic MeSHD013256 enhance MeSHD009132 MeSHQ000254 in MeSHD000818 and MeSHD006801. MeSHD004958 (E2) and MeSHD014204 (TBA) (a synthetic MeSHD013739 analog) increased MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression in bovine MeSHD009132 satellite MeSHD002477 (BSC) MeSHQ000208. The MeSHD006040 of this study was to evaluate the mechanisms responsible for this increase by evaluating the effects of ICI 182 780 (an E2 receptor antagonist), MeSHD005485 (an MeSHD011944 inhibitor), G1 (a GPR30 agonist), and BSA-conjugated E2 on E2 and/or TBA-stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression in BSC MeSHQ000208. MeSHD005485 completely suppressed TBA-stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression in BSC MeSHQ000208. ICI 182 780 did not suppress E2-stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression and 100 nM ICI 182 780 enhanced (93%, p<0.05) MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 levels in BSC MeSHQ000208. G1 (100 nM) stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression (100%, p<0.05) but had no effect on proliferation in BSC MeSHQ000208. MeSHC043090, which cannot cross the MeSHD002462, stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression (approximately 100%, p<0.05) in BSC but even at extremely high concentrations had no effect on proliferation. In summary, our data indicate the E2-stimulation of proliferation and E2-stimulation of MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression in BSC MeSHQ000208 occur via different mechanisms. Our previous results showing that ICI 182 780 inhibited BSC proliferation and results of the current study showing lack of response to MeSHC043090 or G1 suggest that E2-stimulated proliferation in BSC MeSHQ000208 is mediated through classical MeSHD011960. Stimulation by ICI 182 780, G1 and MeSHC043090 suggests the E2-stimulated MeSHD007334 MeSHD012333 expression in BSC MeSHQ000208 is mediated through the GPR30 receptor.
26336390	Penetrating MeSHD009333 MeSHQ000293.	Aim of the study is to present our own experiences in the MeSHQ000628 of people suffering from penetrating MeSHD009333 MeSHQ000293. In the years 1996-2012, 10 MeSHD010361 with penetrating MeSHD009333 MeSHQ000293 were treated, including 3 MeSHD014930 and 7 MeSHD008571. The MeSHD010361' age ranged from 16 to 55 (the average age being 40.7 years). In 9 cases the MeSHD014947 was caused by cutting or stabbing, while in one case it was inflicted by a gunshot. In 8 MeSHD010361 it was a single cut MeSHD014947, while one MeSHD010361 suffered from 34 MeSHD014951 to the MeSHD009333, MeSHD013909 and MeSHD013270. Two cut MeSHQ000293 resulted from a MeSHD013406. The remaining MeSHQ000293 were the result of a MeSHD003415. All MeSHD010361 underwent immediate MeSHQ000601, which involved revision of the MeSHD009333 MeSHQ000293 in 8 cases, one longitudinal MeSHD056346 and one left-sided MeSHD013908. The indications for MeSHQ000601 included increased MeSHD013352 in 5 MeSHD010361, MeSHD006470 from the MeSHD014947 in 3 MeSHD010361, and mediastinal MeSHD006406 in 2 MeSHD010361. The damage assessed intraoperatively included tracheal damage in 6 MeSHD010361, damage to carotid vessels in 3 MeSHD010361, MeSHD007830 in 2 MeSHD010361, thoracic vessels in 2 MeSHD010361, oesophagus in 1 MeSHD010361 and MeSHD013961 in 1 MeSHD010361. In 9 MeSHD010361, the MeSHQ000628 yielded positive results. The MeSHD010361 with a MeSHD014948 died during the MeSHQ000601 due to massive MeSHD006470 from the MeSHD001011. In MeSHD010361 with penetrating MeSHD009333 MeSHQ000293, early and rapid diagnostics allows one to determine the indications for MeSHQ000601 and prevent serious fatal MeSHQ000150.
22794915	MeSHD059467-wide MeSHD011795 and expression MeSHQ000032 of stress-responsive NAC MeSHD005796 in MeSHD031202 lavandulifolium.	The MeSHD010944-specific NAC (NAM, ATAF, and CUC) MeSHD014157 MeSHD005190 MeSHD010988 a vital MeSHD012380 in various MeSHD010944 MeSHQ000254 and developmental processes as well as in stress resistance. Using MeSHD017423, we found that the ClNAC MeSHD005796 (ClNAC1-44) were the most strongly up-regulated MeSHD014157 MeSHD005190 in MeSHD031202 lavandulifolium leaves under MeSHD012492 MeSHQ000628. We carried out MeSHD020133 to monitor ClNAC MeSHD005796 response against multiple stresses and hormonal MeSHQ000628 including MeSHD012492, MeSHD055864, MeSHD003080, MeSHD006358, MeSHD000040 and MeSHD020156 MeSHQ000628. The results showed that 35 ClNAC MeSHD005796 were differentially expressed in different organ, and 32 ClNAC MeSHD005796 could respond to at least 2 kinds of MeSHQ000628. MeSHD060888 showed that 10 ClNAC MeSHD005796 belonging to 7 different subfamilies could respond to at least 5 kinds of MeSHQ000628. Over 50-fold variation in transcriptional levels of ClNAC17 and ClNAC21 MeSHD005796 was observed under 6 different types of MeSHQ000628. In the present study, high-level expression of ClNAC MeSHD005796 under MeSHD013312 and hormonal MeSHQ000628 suggests that the NAC MeSHD014157 MeSHD010988 important MeSHD012380 in MeSHD013312 tolerance and adaptation.
27383611	Van der Waals molecular interactions in the organic functionalization of graphane, MeSHC005625, and germanane with MeSHD000475 and MeSHD000480 molecules: a DFT-D2 study.	MeSHD000077318 with the addition of a semi-empirical dispersion potential was applied to the conventional Kohn-Sham energy to study the MeSHD000327 of MeSHD000475 and MeSHD000480 molecules on MeSHD006859-terminated two-dimensional group IV systems (graphane, MeSHC005625, and germanane) by means of a radical-initiated reaction. In particular, we investigated the interactions of MeSHD000114, MeSHC036216, and MeSHD020058 with those surfaces. Although we had studied these systems previously, we included van der Waals interactions in all of the cases examined in the present MeSHD014937. These forces, which are noncovalent interactions, can heavily influence different processes in molecular MeSHD002621, such as the MeSHD000327 of organic molecules on MeSHD012666 surfaces. This unified approach allowed us to perform a MeSHD003160 of the relative reactivities of the various organic molecule/surface systems. The results showed that the degree of covalency of the surface, the lattice size, and the partial MeSHD005249 MeSHQ000600 (caused by differences in electronegativity) are all key MeSHD004602 that determine the reactivity between the molecules and the surfaces tested in this MeSHD014937. The covalent MeSHD019368 of graphane gives rise to energetically favorable intermediate states, while the opposite polarities of the MeSHD005249 MeSHQ000600 of MeSHC005625 and germanane with the organic molecules favor subsequent steps of the radical-initiated reaction. Finally, the lattice size is a factor that has important consequences due to steric effects present in the systems and the possibility of chain reaction continuation. The results obtained in this MeSHD014937 show that careful selection of the substrate is very important. Calculated energy barriers, MeSHD006358 of MeSHD000327, and optimized atomic structures show that the MeSHC005625 system offers the best reactivity in organic functionalization.
25241011	Ratios and MeSHD009726 MeSHD000078329: the vexed case of MeSHD004636.	Within MeSHD001315 MeSHQ000451 unions are pursuing mandated MeSHD009726-MeSHD010361 ratios to safeguard MeSHD010361 outcomes and protect their members in MeSHD003695 where demand perpetually exceeds MeSHQ000600. Establishing ratios for an MeSHD004636 is more contentious than for MeSHD006761 wards. The study's aim was to estimate average MeSHD000078329 levels, skill mix and MeSHD010361 presentations in all MeSHD009517 (NSW) MeSHD004636 (EDs). The design was a retrospective historical MeSHD019352 audit. MeSHD009726 rosters and MeSHD010361 presentation data were collected for three randomly selected MeSHD019352 days in May 2010. Twenty-six valid responses out of 44 were returned. A ratio of the number of MeSHD001513 per MeSHD009726 was calculated as well as skill mix and MeSHD001509. The average MeSHD001513 per MeSHD009726 ratios found were 3.8 (morning shift), 3.6 (evening), and 5.1 (night). However, ratios as high as 8.4 (morning), 7.3 (evening) and 16.0 (night) were identified on particular shifts. MeSHD016424 a rich skill mix was found with an average of 90% of MeSHQ000451 hours being provided by MeSHD009726. The average daily MeSHD001509 of 4 MeSHD010361 per MeSHD001513 was similar across ED levels. The study adds to the limited MeSHD008091 on ED MeSHD000078329 and demonstrates the utility in the simplicity of ratios in flagging potential MeSHD000078329 problems. The audit revealed wide variation in MeSHD000078329 levels which was not always linked to MeSHD010361 activity. Of particular concern were the regional EDs (Level 5) which have the capacity to deal with all types of MeSHD004630 but where ratios as high as 7 MeSHD001513 per MeSHD009726 were found during the day. Ratios cannot be used to determine the optimal MeSHD000078329 levels in every clinical situation; their purpose is to force an increase in MeSHQ000451 MeSHQ000600 and to prevent individual units from becoming understaffed.
28523077	Enhanced biomethane MeSHD004467 rate and yield from lignocellulosic ensiled forage ley by in situ anaerobic MeSHD004063 MeSHQ000628 with endogenous cellulolytic MeSHD004798.	Enzymatic MeSHQ000628 of lignocellulosic material for increased MeSHD056804 MeSHD004467 has so far focused on pretreatment MeSHQ000379. However, often combinations of MeSHD004798 and different physicochemical MeSHQ000628 are necessary to achieve a desired effect. This need for additional energy and chemicals compromises the rationale of using MeSHD004798 for low energy MeSHQ000628 to promote MeSHD056804 MeSHD004467. Therefore, simpler and less energy intensive in situ anaerobic digester MeSHQ000628 with MeSHD004798 is desirable. However, investigations in which exogenous MeSHD004798 are added to treat the material in situ have shown mixed success, possibly because the MeSHD004798 used originated from organisms not evolutionarily adapted to the MeSHD004777 of anaerobic digesters. In this study, to examine the effect of MeSHD004798 endogenous to methanogenic MeSHD064307, cellulolytic MeSHD004798 were instead overproduced and collected from a dedicated methanogenic MeSHD064307. By this approach, a MeSHD012996 with very high endogenous microbial cellulolytic activity was produced and tested for the effect on MeSHD056804 MeSHD004467 from MeSHC036909 by in situ anaerobic digester MeSHQ000628. Addition of MeSHD004798, endogenous to the MeSHD004777 of a mixed methanogenic MeSHD064307, to the anaerobic MeSHD004063 of ensiled forage ley resulted in significantly increased rate and yield of biomethane MeSHD004467. The MeSHD004798 MeSHD012996 had an instant effect on more readily available cellulosic material. More importantly, the induced MeSHD004798 MeSHD012996 also affected the MeSHD056804 MeSHD004467 rate from less accessible cellulosic material in a second slower phase of MeSHC036909 MeSHD004063. Notably, this effect was maintained throughout the experiment to completely digested lignocellulosic substrate. The induced MeSHD004798 MeSHD012996 collected from a microbial methanogenic MeSHD012111 contained MeSHD004798 that were apparently active and stable in the MeSHD004777 of anaerobic MeSHD004063. The enzymatic activity had a profound effect on the MeSHD056804 MeSHD004467 rate and yield, comparable with the results of many pretreatment MeSHQ000379. Thus, application of such MeSHD004798 could enable efficient low energy in situ anaerobic digester MeSHQ000628 for increased biomethane MeSHD004467 from lignocellulosic material.
27794624	Modeling the MeSHD005951 in normal and impaired MeSHD005947 tolerant states: a MeSHD011153 approach.	The conventional approach to analyzing data from MeSHD005951 testing (MeSHD005951) requires model identification in each individual separately (standard two stage, STS), ignoring MeSHD019359 about the MeSHD011153 as a whole. In practice, however, the MeSHD005951 is sparsely sampled and individual estimates are often not resolvable from available data. This weakness is often encountered in large scale trials or MeSHD016021, leading to either multiple imputations or simply much less data available for MeSHQ000032. We have applied a MeSHD011153 approach, nonlinear mixed effects modeling, to MeSHD010949 MeSHD005947, MeSHD007328 and MeSHD002096 data obtained from a 120 minute MeSHD005951 undertaken by 106 subjects with varying MeSHD005947 tolerance. This MeSHD008722 provides estimates of MeSHD011153 means, variances and covariances of model parameters and empirical Bayes estimates of individual parameter values, as well as MeSHD014894 of intra-individual (within-subject) and inter-individual (between-subject) variability. The recently developed oral MeSHD005947 minimal model was used to evaluate MeSHD007333, and a combined model approach was used to assess β-MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000378. Applying these models allowed for the reconstruction of MeSHD000078790 and MeSHD005947 MeSHD000042 profiles and gave MeSHD011153 MeSHD020481 of MeSHD007333 (SI = 6.51 ± 1.20 × 10-4 min-1·μU-1·ml), fractional hepatic extraction of MeSHD007328 (F = 0.522 ± 0.291) and fractional MeSHD007328 clearance (kI = 0.258 ± 0.151 min-1). Whereas the traditional approach to parameter estimation failed to recover estimates in more than one third of the MeSHD011153, the MeSHD011153 approach provided individual estimates in all subjects. Examination of the empirical Bayes estimates showed that individual parameter estimates were able to differentiate well between individuals at MeSHD005947 tolerant states ranging from euglycemia to overt MeSHD003924. Our MeSHQ000175 suggest that MeSHD011153 MeSHQ000032 is a powerful tool for obtaining accurate assessments of MeSHD020481 of MeSHD007333 and β-MeSHD002477 MeSHQ000502 from the MeSHD005951, especially in MeSHD016021 with large numbers of sparsely sampled subjects.
24708058	One- and two-MeSHD003116 resonant photoionization MeSHD013057 of MeSHD002857-doped MeSHD006371 nanodroplets.	We investigate the photoinduced MeSHD012063 dynamics of Cr atoms embedded into superfluid MeSHD006371 nanodroplets. One- and two-MeSHD003116 resonant two-photon ionization (1CR2PI and 2CR2PI, respectively) are applied to study the two strong ground state transitions z(7)P(2,3,4)° ← a(7)S3 and y(7)P(2,3,4)° ← a(7)S3. Upon photoexcitation, Cr* atoms are ejected from the droplet in various excited states, as well as paired with MeSHD006371 atoms as Cr*–He(n) exciplexes. For the y(7)P(2,3,4)° intermediate state, comparison of the two MeSHQ000379 reveals that energetically lower states than previously identified are also populated. With 1CR2PI we find that the MeSHD011153 of ejected z(5)P3° states is reduced for increasing droplet size, indicating that MeSHD011153 is transferred preferentially to lower states during longer interaction with the droplet. In the 2CR2PI spectra we find evidence for generation of bare Cr atoms in their septet ground state (a(7)S3) and metastable quintet state (a(5)S2), which we attribute to a photoinduced fast excitation–MeSHD012063 cycle mediated by the droplet. A fraction of Cr atoms in these ground and metastable states is attached to MeSHD006371 atoms, as indicated by blue wings next to bare atom spectral lines. These MeSHD012063 channels provide new insight into the interaction of excited transition MeSHD008670 atoms with MeSHD006371 nanodroplets.
24884467	Distinguishing MeSHD014901 using a recombinant envelope MeSHD011506 with MeSHD009154 in the conserved fusion-loop.	MeSHD014902 (WNV) is an emerging MeSHD009033-transmitted MeSHD005416 that continues to spread and cause MeSHD004194 throughout several parts of the world, including MeSHD005060 and the MeSHD000569. Specific MeSHD003933 of MeSHD014901 using current serological testing is complicated by the high degree of cross-reactivity between MeSHD000906 against other clinically relevant MeSHD005416, including MeSHD003715, MeSHD004675 (TBEV), MeSHD004672 (JEV), and MeSHD015004 (YFV) MeSHD014780. Cross-reactivity is particularly problematic in areas where different MeSHD005416 co-circulate or in MeSHD011153 that have been immunized with MeSHD014612 against TBEV, JEV, or YFV. The majority of cross-reactive MeSHD000906 against the immunodominant MeSHD005416 envelope (E) MeSHD011506 target a conserved MeSHD000939 in the fusion loop at the distal end of domain II. We tested a loss-of-MeSHQ000502 bacterially expressed recombinant WNV E MeSHD011506 containing MeSHD009154 in the fusion loop and an adjacent loop domain as a possible diagnostic MeSHD007202. By comparing the binding of sera from MeSHD006801 infected with WNV or other MeSHD005416 to the wild type and the mutant E MeSHD011506, we analyzed the potential of this MeSHD013672 to specifically detect WNV MeSHD000906. Using this system, we could reliably determine MeSHD014901. MeSHD000906 from WNV-infected individuals bound equally well to the wild type and the MeSHD050505. In contrast, sera from MeSHD009272 infected with other MeSHD005416 showed significantly decreased binding to the MeSHD050505. By calculating the mean differences between antibody signals detected using the wild type and the MeSHD050505, a value could be assigned for each of the MeSHD005416, which distinguished their pattern of reactivity. Recombinant mutant E MeSHD011506 can be used to discriminate MeSHD007239 with WNV from those with other MeSHD005416. The data have important implications for the MeSHQ000254 of improved, specific serological assays for the detection of WNV MeSHD000906 in regions where other MeSHD005416 co-circulate or in MeSHD011153 that are immunized with other MeSHD005416 MeSHD014612.
23170859	Quantitative MeSHD040901 by MeSHD000596 labeling in MeSHD029544 (FMDV)-infected MeSHD002477.	MeSHD029544 (FMDV) is an important MeSHD004194 agent that can be difficult to effectively eradicate from herds. Because it is an obligate intracellular MeSHD010271, the MeSHD014780 has multiple effects on the host MeSHD002477 during MeSHD007239. Here, a high-throughput quantitative proteomic approach was used to develop an unbiased holistic overview of the MeSHD011506 changes in IBRS-2 MeSHD002477 infected with FMDV. MeSHD007553 with MeSHD000596 in MeSHD018929 (SILAC) combined with LC-MS/MS was performed to identify and quantify 1260 cellular and 2 MeSHD014764 after 6 h of MeSHD007239 of IBRS-2 MeSHD002477 with FMDV. Of these identified and measured cellular MeSHD011506 pairs, 77 were significantly up-regulated, and 50 were significantly down-regulated based on significance B ≤ 0.05. The differentially altered MeSHD011506 included a number of MeSHD011506 involved in endolysosomal MeSHD010447 system, MeSHD002453, cellular MeSHQ000254 and proliferation, and immune MeSHD002477 trafficking. Selected data were validated by MeSHD015153. Ingenuity Pathway MeSHQ000032 revealed that MeSHD011506 that changed in response to MeSHD007239 could be assigned to defined canonical pathways and functional groupings, such as MeSHD016023 signaling. The obtained data might not only improve the MeSHD032882 of the dynamics of FMDV and host interaction but may also help elucidate the pathogenic mechanism of FMDV MeSHD007239.
22595006	Comparison of data-merging MeSHQ000379 with SVM attribute selection and MeSHD002965 in MeSHD001943 MeSHD015870.	MeSHD020411 data are used to identify MeSHD005796 which could be considered prognostic markers. However, due to the limited MeSHD018401 of each study, the signatures are unstable in terms of the composing MeSHD005796 and may be limited in terms of performances. It is therefore of great interest to integrate different studies, thus increasing MeSHD018401. In the past, several studies explored the issue of microarray data merging, but the arrival of new MeSHQ000379 and a focus on SVM based MeSHD002965 needed further investigation. We used distant MeSHD009362 prediction based on SVM attribute selection and MeSHD002965 to three MeSHD001943 MeSHD064886. The results showed that MeSHD001943 MeSHD002965 does not benefit from data merging, confirming the results found by other studies with different MeSHQ000379.
18235058	MeSHD057231: the MeSHD011634 response.	There is scientific MeSHD032921 that the global MeSHD002980 is changing, with rising surface MeSHD013696, MeSHD005615 MeSHD007053 and MeSHD012914, MeSHD000080763, and increasing MeSHD002980 variability. These changes are expected to have substantial impacts on MeSHD006801 MeSHD006262. There are known, effective MeSHD011634 responses for many of these impacts, but the scope, timeline, and complexity of MeSHD057231 are unprecedented. We propose a MeSHD011634 approach to MeSHD057231, based on the essential MeSHD014492, that extends to both clinical and MeSHD000075485 services and emphasizes the coordination of MeSHD006077 (federal, state, and local), academia, the MeSHD017149, and MeSHD009938.
21793590	Isoenergetic microarrays to study the structure and interactions of DsrA and OxyS MeSHD012313 in two- and three-component complexes.	Information on the MeSHQ000556 structure and interactions of MeSHD012313 is important to understand the MeSHD001688 MeSHQ000502 of MeSHD012313 as well as in applying MeSHD012313 as a tool for MeSHD013812 purposes. Recently, the isoenergetic microarray mapping MeSHD008722 was developed to improve the prediction of MeSHD012313 MeSHQ000556 structure. Herein, for the first MeSHD013995, isoenergetic microarrays were used to study the binding of MeSHD012313 to MeSHD011506 or other MeSHD012313 as well as the interactions of two different MeSHD012313 and MeSHD011506 in a three-component complex. The MeSHD012313 used as models were the regulatory DsrA and OxyS MeSHD012313 from MeSHD004926, the fragments of their target MeSHD012333 (fhlA and rpoS), and their complexes with Hfq MeSHD011506. The collected results showed the advantages and some limitations of microarray mapping.
23423257	Antineutrophil MeSHD003593 antibody-associated MeSHD014657: recent MeSHQ000254.	Antineutrophil MeSHD003593 antibody (MeSHD019268)-associated MeSHD014657 (AAV) is a group of MeSHD014657 characterized by small-to-medium-sized MeSHD001808 MeSHD014657 and the presence of MeSHD019268. Although our MeSHD032882 of the MeSHQ000209 of AAV remains limited, new information supporting an autoimmune basis is emerging. This MeSHD016454 highlights recent progresses in MeSHQ000209, MeSHQ000209, MeSHD002965, and MeSHQ000628. A MeSHD055106 has confirmed a MeSHD012380 for MeSHD020022 in AAV, and links between environmental factors and AAV induction through abnormal MeSHD065206 has been demonstrated. Ongoing international MeSHD032921 initiatives have revised approaches to the MeSHD002965 of MeSHD014657 that has been enhanced by the MeSHQ000032 of large-scale prospective clinical MeSHD064886. New MeSHD001323 to MeSHD006801 MeSHD051907-2 antibody, MeSHC071058, and MeSHD010958 have been detected in AAV sera and a prognostic MeSHD002965 of renal MeSHQ000473 developed. MeSHD016430 networks have extended the evidence base for the MeSHQ000628 of AAV, and MeSHD000069283 has emerged as an alternative to MeSHD003520 for MeSHD012074. Long-term outcomes following current MeSHQ000628 strategies have been determined and increased MeSHD012306 for cardiovascular and malignant MeSHD004194 reported.
22011331	Helical conformations of semiflexible MeSHD011108 confined between two concentric cylinders.	An off-lattice MeSHD009010 was used to study the conformational properties of semiflexible chains confined between two concentric cylinders. The conformations of confined semiflexible chains depend on the bending energy as well as the size of confinement, and the semiflexible chains with particular rigidities confined in the appropriate spaces can MeSHD020478 helical structures under entropically driven. The inner cylinder MeSHD010988 a key MeSHD012380 in the formation of helical conformations, whereas the outer cylinder MeSHD000339 the size of confinement. Furthermore, the helical structures keep fluctuating like a harmonic oscillation, and the clockwise or counterclockwise helical conformations MeSHD014836 appear with the same possibility in the processes of MeSHD012063-helix transitions. This study can help us understand the conformational MeSHD001519 of MeSHD001688 macromolecules in MeSHD020378.
19144966	D-MeSHD003523 potentiates the reconsolidation of MeSHD003042-associated MeSHD008568.	Conditioned MeSHD003463-induced MeSHD012008 to MeSHD004364 seeking is a major challenge to the MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD019966. It has been proposed that D-MeSHD003523 might be useful in the MeSHQ000517 of MeSHD012008 by reducing the conditioned reinforcing properties of MeSHD004364-associated stimuli through facilitation of extinction. Here we show that intrabasolateral MeSHD000679 infusions of D-MeSHD003523 in fact potentiate the reconsolidation of stimulus-MeSHD003042 MeSHD008568 to increase MeSHD003463-induced MeSHD012008 to MeSHD004364 seeking in MeSHD051381 with an extensive MeSHD004364 MeSHD012646 MeSHQ000266. This elevation of MeSHD003042 seeking was correlated with an increase in the expression of the reconsolidation-associated MeSHD005796 zif268.
22238266	Detecting genomic indel variants with exact breakpoints in single- and paired-end sequencing data using SplazerS.	The reliable detection of genomic variation in resequencing data is still a major challenge, especially for variants larger than a few MeSHD020029. Sequencing reads crossing boundaries of structural variation carry the potential for their identification, but are difficult to MeSHD019532. Here we present a MeSHD008722 for 'split' read mapping, where prefix and MeSHC013842 match of a read may be interrupted by a longer gap in the read-to-reference alignment. We MeSHQ000706 this MeSHD008722 to accurately detect medium-sized insertions and long deletions with precise breakpoints in genomic resequencing data. Compared with alternative split mapping MeSHQ000379, SplazerS significantly improves MeSHD012680 for detecting large indel events, especially in variant-rich regions. Our MeSHD008722 is robust in the presence of sequencing errors as well as alignment errors due to genomic MeSHD009154/divergence, and can be used on reads of variable lengths. Our MeSHQ000032 shows that SplazerS is a versatile tool applicable to unanchored or single-end as well as anchored paired-end reads. In addition, application of SplazerS to targeted resequencing data led to the interesting discovery of a complete, possibly functional MeSHD005796 retrocopy variant. SplazerS is available from http://www.seqan.de/projects/ splazers. Supplementary data are available at MeSHD019295 online.
25078870	Pharmacological modulation of MeSHD001343 enhances MeSHD009522-mediated oncolysis in MeSHD004364-resistant MeSHD008175 MeSHD002477.	MeSHD050504 represent a promising MeSHQ000628 against MeSHD009369 with acquired MeSHD004351. However, low efficacy limits its clinical application. The objective of this study is to investigate whether pharmacologically modulating MeSHD001343 could enhance oncolytic MeSHD009522 (NDV) MeSHD013180 NDV/FMW virotherapy of MeSHD004364-resistant MeSHD008175 MeSHD002477. The effect of NDV/FMW MeSHD007239 on MeSHD001343 machinery in A549 MeSHD008175 MeSHD002460 resistant to MeSHD002945 (A549/DDP) or MeSHD017239 (A549/PTX) was investigated by detection of GFP-MeSHD008869 MeSHD008027 chain 3 (GFP-LC3) puncta, formation of double-MeSHD008566 vesicles and conversion of the nonlipidated MeSHD020478 of LC3 (LC3-I) to the MeSHC483858-conjugated MeSHD020478 (LC3-II). The effects of MeSHD001343 inhibitor MeSHD002738 (CQ) and MeSHD001343 inducer MeSHD020123 on NDV/FMW-mediated antitumor activity were evaluated both in MeSHQ000208 MeSHD002477 and in MeSHD051379 bearing MeSHD004364-resistant MeSHD008175 MeSHD002477. We show that NDV/FMW triggers MeSHD001343 in A549/PTX MeSHD002477 via dampening the class I MeSHD019869/Akt/mTOR/p70S6K pathway, which inhibits MeSHD001343. On the contrary, NDV/FMW MeSHD007239 attenuates the autophagic process in A549/DDP MeSHD002477 through the activation of the negative regulatory pathway. Furthermore, combination with CQ or knockdown of ATG5 significantly enhances NDV/FMW-mediated antitumor effects on A549/DDP MeSHD002477, while the oncolytic efficacy of NDV/FMW in A549/PTX MeSHD002477 is significantly improved by MeSHD020123. Interestingly, MeSHD001343 modulation does not increase MeSHD014780 progeny in these MeSHD004364 resistant MeSHD002477. Importantly, CQ or MeSHD020123 significantly potentiates NDV/FMW oncolytic activity in MeSHD051379 bearing A549/DDP or A549/PTX MeSHD002477 respectively. These results demonstrate that combination MeSHQ000628 with MeSHD001343 modulators is an effective strategy to augment the MeSHD013812 activity of NDV/FMW against MeSHD004364-resistant MeSHD008175.
24433454	MeSHD015233 to predict MeSHD003924 remission after MeSHD050110.	MeSHD003924 (T2D) remission may be achieved after MeSHD050110 (BS), but rates vary according to MeSHD010361' baseline characteristics. The present study evaluates the relevance of several preoperative factors and develops MeSHD015233 to predict T2D remission 1 year after BS. We retrospectively studied 141 MeSHD010361 (57.4% MeSHD014930), with a preoperative MeSHD003933 of T2D, who underwent BS in a single center (2006-2011). Anthropometric and MeSHD005947 MeSHQ000378 parameters before MeSHQ000601 and at 1-year follow-up were recorded. Remission of T2D was defined according to MeSHD032921 MeSHQ000592: MeSHD006442 <6%, MeSHD005215 MeSHD005947 (FG) <100 mg/dL, absence of pharmacologic MeSHQ000628. The influence of several preoperative factors was explored and different MeSHD015233 to predict T2D remission were elaborated using MeSHD016015 MeSHQ000032. Three preoperative characteristics considered individually were identified as the most powerful predictors of T2D remission: MeSHD002096 (R2  = 0.249; MeSHD016017 [OR] 1.652, 95% MeSHD016001 [CI] 1.181-2.309; P = 0.003), T2D duration (R2  = 0.197; OR 0.869, 95% CI 0.808-0.935; P < 0.001), and previous MeSHD007328 MeSHQ000628 (R2  = 0.165; OR 4.670, 95% CI 2.257-9.665; P < 0.001). High MeSHD002096 levels, a shorter duration of T2D, and the absence of MeSHD007328 MeSHQ000628 favored remission. Different multivariate MeSHD016015 models were designed. When considering MeSHD012723, T2D duration, and MeSHD007328 MeSHQ000628, remission was correctly predicted in 72.4% of cases. The model that included age, FG and MeSHD002096 levels resulted in 83.7% correct MeSHD002965. When MeSHD012723, FG, MeSHD002096, MeSHD007328 MeSHQ000628, and percentage MeSHD015431 were considered, correct MeSHD002965 of T2D remission was achieved in 95.9% of cases. Preoperative characteristics determine T2D remission rates after BS to different extents. The MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD015233 may help clinicians reliably predict T2D remission rates after BS.
18482078	Effects of revised diagnostic recommendations on MeSHD008288 MeSHQ000628 practices across MeSHD009273 in MeSHD007630.	The recent change of MeSHQ000628 MeSHD057766 for uncomplicated MeSHD008288 from MeSHD013413-pyrime-thamine to MeSHD000077611 (AL) in MeSHD007630 was accompanied by revised MeSHD008288 MeSHD003933 recommendations promoting presumptive MeSHD000962 MeSHQ000628 in young MeSHD002648 and parasitological MeSHD003933 in MeSHD010361 5 years and older. We evaluated the impact of these age-specific recommendations on routine MeSHD008288 MeSHQ000628 practices 4-6 months after AL MeSHQ000628 was implemented. Cross-sectional, cluster sample MeSHD011795 using MeSHD011787 assessment MeSHQ000379 in all MeSHD006076 facilities in four Kenyan districts. MeSHQ000032 was restricted to the 64 facilities with MeSHD008288 diagnostics and AL available on the MeSHD011795 day. Main MeSHD017063 were MeSHD000962 MeSHQ000628 practices for febrile MeSHD010361 stratified by age, MeSHQ000706 of MeSHD008288 MeSHD003955, and test result. MeSHQ000628 practices for 706 febrile MeSHD010361 (401 young MeSHD002648 and 305 MeSHD010361 > or =5 years) were evaluated. 43.0% of MeSHD010361 > or =5 years and 25.9% of MeSHD002648 underwent parasitological MeSHD008288 testing (87% by MeSHD008853). AL was prescribed for 79.7% of MeSHD010361 > or =5 years with positive test results, for 9.7% with MeSHD000076723 and for 10.9% without a test. 84.6% of MeSHD002648 with positive tests, 19.2% with negative tests, and 21.6% without tests were treated with AL. At least one MeSHD000962 was prescribed for 75.0% of MeSHD002648 and for 61.3% of MeSHD010361 > or =5 years with a negative test result. Despite different recommendations for MeSHD010361 below and above 5 years of age, MeSHD008288 MeSHD003933 and MeSHQ000628 practices were similar in the two MeSHD009273. Parasitological MeSHD003933 was under-used in older MeSHD002648 and MeSHD000328, and young MeSHD002648 were still tested. MeSHQ000706 of AL was low MeSHD016424 and alternative MeSHD000962 were commonly prescribed; but AL prescribing largely followed the results of MeSHD008288 tests. MeSHD008288 MeSHD003933 recommendations differing between MeSHD009273 appear complex to implement; further strengthening of MeSHD003933 and MeSHQ000628 practices under AL MeSHD057766 is required.
21864486	MeSHD019409 enhances MeSHD000069283-dependent cytotoxicity against MeSHD015451 MeSHD002477 and overcomes MeSHD016212-mediated MeSHD007165.	Chemoimmunotherapy with anti-CD20 MeSHD000911 MeSHD000069283 is increasingly used for the MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD010361 with MeSHD015451 (CLL). Antibody-dependent cytotoxicity (MeSHD000920) is one of the most important MeSHQ000494 of MeSHD000069283 against B-MeSHD002477 MeSHD009369. We studied ways to increase the cytotoxic effect of MeSHD000069283 on CLL MeSHD002477 by enhancing MeSHD000920. MeSHD007963 (PBMC) or purified natural killer (NK) MeSHD002477 from healthy MeSHD014019 were activated with MeSHD019409 (MeSHD019409) and cultured with MeSHD000069283-coated CLL MeSHD002477, and MeSHD000920 was evaluated using a (51)MeSHD002857 release MeSHQ000032. The MeSHD019409 significantly enhanced in vitro MeSHD000920 against CLL MeSHD002477, and this effect was mainly mediated by MeSHD007694. The MeSHD019409 treated effector MeSHD002477 with the low affinity FcγRIIIA receptor (158FF) had an MeSHD000920 comparable to those with the high affinity FcγRIIIA MeSHD020478 (158VF). In addition, MeSHD019409 enhanced MeSHD000069283-mediated MeSHD000920 of CLL MeSHD002477 in the presence of MeSHD016212. The MeSHD019409 increases MeSHD000069283-mediated MeSHD000920 against CLL, and supports the MeSHQ000706 of such agents with the MeSHD006040 of improving clinical response to chemoimmunotherapy in MeSHD010361 with CLL.
20304259	MeSHD014612 against MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD058873.	The MeSHD014944 (MeSHD014944) has reported, as of September 2009, that the MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD007251 MeSHD058873 has originated >300,000 MeSHD007753-confirmed cases and 3917 MeSHD003643 in 191 countries. It is recognized that MeSHD058873 MeSHD014612 have their greatest impact as a preventive strategy when administered before or near the peak MeSHD015994 of cases in an outbreak. Therefore, MeSHD017589 should be in place when MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) 2009 MeSHD014612 are available. We undertook this study to provide updated information on clinical evaluation of MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD014612 and MeSHD016454 recommendations for MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD017589 and MeSHD011634 MeSHD057766. The following MeSHQ000379 were used: 1) MeSHD016454 of MeSHD012042 at MeSHD016430.gov. 2) search of MeSHD039781 Central (PMC) for MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD014612. 3) MeSHD016454 of recommendations of MeSHD014944, Mexican MeSHD006262 Secretariat (SSA) and MeSHD026683 on MeSHD007114 Practices (ACIP) on MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD017589. Until October 1, 2009 there were 11 available MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) candidate MeSHD013180 provided by MeSHD014944 Global MeSHD007251 MeSHQ000453 Network. MeSHD016430.gov MeSHD016435 45 phase I and II MeSHD016430 evaluating immunogenicity and MeSHD012449 of MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) MeSHD014612. Preliminary results support MeSHD009934 of a single dose and MeSHQ000706 of adjuvants. Main recommendations of MeSHD014944, SSA and ACIP include epidemiologic considerations, objectives, definition of target groups and reinforcement of other mitigation MeSHD014894. The present MeSHD058873 of MeSHD007251 A (H1N1) has shown mild to moderate severity. MeSHD014611 strategies in MeSHD008800 MeSHD014836 have the objective of decreasing severe outcomes, slowing MeSHQ000635, protecting groups at increased MeSHD012306 of MeSHD007239, MeSHQ000150, or MeSHD003643, and preventing overload of MeSHD006296. MeSHQ000517 of the MeSHD058873 should include reinforcement of other non-pharmacologic MeSHD014894 of mitigation and, importantly, an adequate strategy of MeSHD003142.
23529438	MeSHQ000032 of Ca(2+)-MeSHD001665 in the MthK RCK domain by MeSHD018360.	Regulator of K(+) conductance (RCK) domains MeSHD020478 a conserved class of MeSHD008024-binding domains that MeSHQ000517 the activity of a variety of prokaryotic and eukaryotic K(+) channels. Structural MeSHQ000032 of these domains by MeSHD018360 has provided insight toward mechanisms underlying MeSHD008024 binding and channel gating, and thus the experimental strategies aimed at determining structures of liganded and unliganded MeSHD020478 of the domains may be useful in MeSHQ000032 of other MeSHD008024-binding domains. Here, we describe a basic strategy for crystallographic MeSHQ000032 of the RCK domain from the MthK channel, for MeSHQ000032 of its Ca(2+)-bound structure.
18320262	Solid-phase MeSHQ000517 on MeSHD007854 bioaccessibility in smelter-impacted MeSHD012987.	The MeSHD006040 of this MeSHD014937 was to identify the solid-phase MeSHQ000517 on MeSHD007854 (Pb) bioaccessibility in MeSHD012987 impacted by smelter activities in the city of San Luis Potosi, in north-central MeSHD008800. Total Pb concentrations in 30 ha of MeSHD012987 terrain from a residential area adjacent to the smelter showed levels above the 400-mg/kg intervention MeSHD016431 dictated by Mexican Environmental MeSHD012926. These concentrations, although raising MeSHD006801 MeSHD006262 and environmental concerns, showed low MeSHD014867-soluble MeSHD007854 (<0.1 mg/L) and relatively low MeSHD007854 bioaccessibility (2.4-20.5%). MeSHD014961 and MeSHD008854 MeSHQ000379 showed, in addition to common Pb phases reported in similar contaminated MeSHD004777 [MeSHC018391 (PbS) and anglesite (PbSO(4))], the presence of a solid MeSHC045846 phase. The Pb MeSHD012995 measured in MeSHD012987 agrees very well with the low MeSHD012995 reported for the Pb MeSHD008903 identified and explains the relatively low Pb bioaccessibility values measured, presumably from their low dissolution during passage through the MeSHD041981. The results reported are highly relevant for smelter-originated environmental contamination scenarios in general.
21933785	Molecular and epidemiological characterization of MeSHD015497 MeSHD007239 networks involving transmitted MeSHD004351 MeSHD009154 in Northern MeSHD006115.	To determine the contribution of MeSHQ000635 clusters to transmitted MeSHD004351 (TDR) in newly diagnosed antiretroviral-naive MeSHD015497-infected MeSHD010361 in Northern MeSHD006115 during 2000-07. The MeSHQ000453 of TDR was estimated in 369 individuals who were diagnosed with MeSHD015497 MeSHD007239 in the period 2000-07 at the National MeSHD000163 Reference MeSHD007753 of Northern MeSHD006115. MeSHD010802 was performed using a maximum likelihood MeSHD008722 on partial pol sequences. TDR was defined in accordance with the MeSHQ000453 MeSHD004351 MeSHD009154 list (2009 update). The MeSHD016424 MeSHQ000453 of TDR in our MeSHD011153 was 12.5% [46/369, 95% MeSHD016001 (CI) 9.1%-15.8%], comprising 7.6% (28/369) resistant to MeSHD009705 MeSHD018894, 5.4% (20/369) resistant to non-MeSHD009705 MeSHD018894 and 3.3% (12/369) resistant to MeSHD011480. Dual class resistance was identified in 3.8% (14/369). MeSHD007239 with subtype A was the sole predictor associated with TDR in MeSHD015999 (MeSHD016017 2.15, 95% CI 1.10-4.19, P = 0.025). MeSHD010802 revealed three statistically robust MeSHQ000635 clusters involving MeSHD004364-resistant MeSHD013180, including one cluster of 12 MeSHD010361, 10 of whom were infected with a MeSHD013180 MeSHD017770 both T215 revertants and Y181C MeSHD009154. Our MeSHQ000175 underline the substantial impact of MeSHQ000635 networks on TDR in our MeSHD011153.
29721798	Effects of the chloro-s-MeSHD014227 MeSHD006540 MeSHC037565 on MeSHD004247 integrity in MeSHD006801 and MeSHD051379 MeSHD002477.	MeSHC037565 belongs to the chloro-s-MeSHD014227 group of MeSHD006540 and acts primarily as a MeSHD010788 inhibitor. The MeSHQ000494 related to its exposure, relevant both in MeSHD000818 and MeSHD006801, are still insufficiently investigated. This comprehensive study focused on the outcomes of MeSHC037565 exposure at MeSHD002477 level MeSHD066298, and a MeSHD051379 model in vivo. Experiments MeSHD066298 were conducted on whole MeSHD006801 peripheral MeSHQ000097, isolated MeSHD008214, and MeSHD056945 exposed for 4 h to MeSHC037565 at 8.00, 0.80, and 0.58 ng/mL, which is comparable with current MeSHD012016 set by the European Commission in 2011. MeSHC037565 cytotoxicity was evaluated using dual fluorescent MeSHD013194 with MeSHD004996 and MeSHD000165 on MeSHD008214, and MeSHD012844 colorimetric MeSHQ000032 on MeSHD056945. The levels of MeSHD004249 were measured using alkaline and hOGG1-modified MeSHD020552. The potency of terbuthlyazine regarding induction of MeSHD018384 MeSHD066298 was studied using a battery of standard MeSHD018384 MeSHD015415. The in vivo experiment was conducted on Swiss albino MeSHD051379 exposed to terbuthlyazine in the MeSHD020478 of an active substance and its formulated commercial product Radazin TZ-50 at a daily dose of 0.0035 mg/kg bw for 14 days. Following exposure, the MeSHD004249 levels in MeSHD007962, MeSHD001853, MeSHD008099, and MeSHD007668 MeSHD002477 of the treated MeSHD051379 were measured using an MeSHD020552. MeSHD066298 results suggested low MeSHC037565 cytotoxicity in non-target MeSHD002477. The highest tested concentration (8.00 ng/mL) reduced MeSHD008214 viability by 15%, mostly due to MeSHD017209, while cytotoxic effects in MeSHD056945 at the same concentration were negligible. Acute MeSHD066298 exposure of MeSHD006801 MeSHD008214 and MeSHD056945 to MeSHC037565 resulted in low-level MeSHD004247 instability, as detected by the MeSHD020552. Further characterization of the mechanisms behind the MeSHD004249 obtained using the hOGG1-modified MeSHD020552 indicated that MeSHD018384 did not prevail in the MeSHD016424 damage. This was further confirmed by the measured levels of MeSHD018384 markers, which were mostly comparable to MeSHQ000517. Results obtained in MeSHD051379 indicate that both the active substance and formulated commercial product of MeSHC037565 produced MeSHD004247 instability in all of the studied MeSHD002477 types. We found that MeSHD004247 in MeSHD008099 and MeSHD007668 MeSHD002477 was more prone to direct toxic effects of the MeSHD010290 compound and its metabolites than MeSHD004247 in MeSHD007962 and MeSHD001854. The MeSHD016424 MeSHQ000175 suggest the formation of reactive MeSHC037565 metabolites capable of inducing MeSHD004247 cross-links, which hinder MeSHD004247 migration. These effects were most pronounced in MeSHD008099 MeSHD002477 in vivo and MeSHD056945 MeSHD066298. To provide a more accurate explanation of the observed effects, additional MeSHD012106 is needed. Nevertheless, the present study provides evidence that MeSHC037565 at concentrations comparable with current MeSHD012016 possesses toxicological MeSHD012306 because it caused low-level MeSHD004247 instability, both at cellular and MeSHD000818 organism level, which should be further established in forthcoming studies.
21643769	MeSHD014644 and positive selection MeSHQ000032 of MeSHD006692 isolates in south MeSHD002681.	MeSHD006692 (CSFV) MeSHQ000209 a highly contagious MeSHD004194 that MeSHD007854 to significant economic losses in the pig MeSHD007221 worldwide. However, there is a paucity of MeSHD019359 on the accurate genotyping of CSFV isolates in south MeSHD002681. This study genotyped the E2 MeSHD005796 of 14 CSFV MeSHD013180 isolated during 2008-2010 from MeSHD034421 in different districts of south MeSHD002681. MeSHD010802 revealed that all of the 14 CSFV isolates were clustered into genetic subgroup 1.1. This contrasts with most parts of MeSHD002681, where group 2 isolates are predominant. Furthermore, the positive selection MeSHD011312 acting on the E(rns) and E2 envelope MeSHD011506 MeSHD005796 of CSFV were assessed and a site-by-site MeSHQ000032 of the dN/dS ratio was performed to identify specific MeSHD003062 that undergo diversification under positive selection. While no significant evidence for positive selection was observed in E(rns), two positively selected sites at MeSHD000596 residues 49 and 72 in the E2 encoding region were identified. Our results revealed that a predominance of subgroup 1.1 CSFV isolates is currently circulating in some districts of south MeSHD002681, which appear to be unrelated to the MeSHD044466 C-MeSHD013180 MeSHD014612. Moreover, the envelope MeSHD011506 MeSHD005796, E2, has undergone positive selection in 14 CSFV MeSHD013180 and two positively selected sites have been identified in this study. MeSHD032882 the MeSHD017720 and functional importance of these positively selected MeSHD000596 positions could help to predict possible changes in MeSHQ000472, the MeSHQ000254 of MeSHD014612 and MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000517.
24812252	MeSHD010802 provide the first insights into the evolution of OVATE MeSHD005190 MeSHD011506 in MeSHD019669.	The OVATE MeSHD005796 encodes a nuclear-localized regulatory MeSHD011506 belonging to a distinct MeSHD005190 of MeSHD010944-specific MeSHD011506 known as the OVATE MeSHD005190 MeSHD011506 (OFPs). OVATE was first identified as a key regulator of MeSHD005638 shape in MeSHD018551, with nonsense mutants displaying MeSHD031989-shaped MeSHD005638. However, the MeSHD012380 of OFPs in MeSHD063245 has been poorly characterized. Public MeSHD019991 were searched and a total of 265 putative OVATE MeSHD011506 sequences were identified from 13 sequenced MeSHD018745 that represent the major evolutionary lineages of MeSHD019669. A MeSHD010802 was conducted based on the alignment of the conserved OVATE domain from these 13 selected MeSHD018745. The expression patterns of MeSHD018551 SlOFP MeSHD005796 were analysed via MeSHD060888. The pattern of OVATE MeSHD020440 resulting in the expansion of the MeSHD005796 MeSHD005190 was determined in MeSHD017360, MeSHD012275 and MeSHD018551. MeSHD005796 for OFPs were found to be present in all the sampled MeSHD019669 MeSHD016678, including the early-diverged lineages, MeSHD044002 and lycophytes. MeSHD010802 based on the MeSHD000595 of the conserved OVATE domain defined 11 sub-groups of OFPs in MeSHD019684. Different evolutionary mechanisms are proposed for OVATE MeSHD005190 evolution, namely conserved evolution and divergent expansion. Characterization of the AtOFP MeSHD005190 in MeSHD017360, the OsOFP MeSHD005190 in MeSHD012275 and the SlOFP MeSHD005190 in MeSHD018551 provided further details regarding the evolutionary framework and revealed a major contribution of tandem and MeSHD056916 towards expansion of the OVATE MeSHD005796 MeSHD005190. This first MeSHD016678-wide MeSHD011795 on OFPs provides new insights into the evolution of the OVATE MeSHD011506 MeSHD005190 and establishes a solid base for MeSHD005544 MeSHD023281 studies on this important but poorly characterized regulatory MeSHD011506 MeSHD005190 in MeSHD010944.
28468769	An MeSHD000818-Like MeSHD056931 MeSHQ000517 the MeSHD002696 Sexual Cycle.	MeSHD056931 are known as MeSHC024132-binding blue MeSHD008027 receptors in MeSHQ000382, MeSHD005658, MeSHD010944, and MeSHD007313. The MeSHD000818-like MeSHD056931 (aCRY) of the green alga MeSHD016825 has extended our view on MeSHD056931, because it responds also to other wavelengths of the visible spectrum, including red MeSHD008027. Here, we have investigated if aCRY is involved in the MeSHD012926 of the sexual MeSHD008018 of C. reinhardtii, which is controlled by blue and red MeSHD008027 at the steps of MeSHD005718 along with its restoration and MeSHD018525. We show that aCRY is differentially expressed not only during the MeSHD008018 but also within the MeSHD002477 as part of the soluble and/or MeSHD008565 fraction. Moreover, localization of aCRY within the algal MeSHD066146 varies between vegetative MeSHD002477 and the different MeSHD002477 types of MeSHD005718. aCRY is significantly (early day) or to a small extent (late night) enriched in the nucleus in vegetative MeSHD002477. In pregametes, MeSHD005854 and dark-inactivated MeSHD005854, aCRY is localized over the MeSHD066146. aCRY MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in the sexual MeSHD008018 of C. reinhardtii: It MeSHQ000517 the MeSHD018525 of the alga, under which the MeSHD015053 undergoes MeSHD008540, in a positive manner, similar to the MeSHD012926 by the blue MeSHD008027 receptors MeSHD056949 and MeSHD010944 MeSHD056931 (pCRY). However, aCRY acts in combination with pCRY as a negative regulator for mating MeSHD001076 as well as for mating MeSHD008283, opposite to the MeSHQ000502 of MeSHD056949 in these processes.
26971077	MeSHD013534 impact and predictive factors of axillary MeSHD012008 after sentinel MeSHQ000473.	The rate of axillary MeSHD012008 (AR) after MeSHD021701 is usually low but few studies investigated its impact on MeSHD013534. Our aim was to determine the rate and predictive factors of AR in a large cohort of MeSHD001943 MeSHD010361 and its impact on MeSHD013534. From 1999 to 2013, 14,095 MeSHD010361 who underwent MeSHQ000601 for clinically N0 previously untreated MeSHD001943 and had MeSHD021701 were analysed. A simplified score predictive of AR was established. Median follow-up was 55.2 months. AR was observed in 0.51% of cases, with a median MeSHD013995 to onset of 43.4 months. In MeSHD015999, the MeSHQ000453 of AR was significantly correlated with grade 2 or 3 MeSHD004194, absence of MeSHQ000532 and tumour subtype (hormonal receptor [HR]- / MeSHD006801 MeSHD011960 [HER]+). AR rates were 1% for triple-negative tumours, 2.8% for HER2-positive tumours, 0.4% for MeSHD010634 A tumours, 0.9% for HER2-negative MeSHD010634 B tumours, and 0.5% for HER2-positive MeSHD010634 B tumours. A simplified score predictive of the MeSHQ000453 of AR was established. MeSHD010361 could be divided into three different score groups (p < 0.0001). In MeSHD015999, MeSHD016424 MeSHD013534 was significantly lower in cases of AR (p < 0.0001), age >50, lymphovascular invasion, grade 3 MeSHD004194, sentinel node (SN) macrometastases, tumour size >20 mm, absence of MeSHD004358 and triple-negative MeSHD010641. MeSHD013534 in MeSHD010361 with AR was significantly lower in case of early-onset (2 years) AR (p = 0.017). Isolated AR is more common in Her2-positive/HR-negative triple-negative tumours with a more severe MeSHD011379 in triple-negative and Her2-positive/HR-negative tumours, and represents an independent adverse factor justifying an indication for systemic MeSHQ000628 for AR MeSHQ000628. However, the benefit of any systemic MeSHQ000628 remains to be proven.
24856209	MeSHD007328-FOXO3 signaling modulates MeSHD002940 via MeSHD012926 of clock transcription.	MeSHD002940 are responsive to external and internal MeSHD003463, MeSHD008027 and MeSHQ000378 being among the most important. In MeSHD008322, the MeSHD008027 signal is sensed by the MeSHD012160 and transmitted to the MeSHD013493 (SCN) master clock [1], where it is integrated into the molecular oscillator via MeSHD012926 of clock MeSHD005796 transcription. The SCN synchronizes peripheral oscillators, an effect that can be overruled by incoming metabolic signals [2]. As a consequence, peripheral oscillators can be uncoupled from the master clock when MeSHD008027 and metabolic signals are not in phase. The signaling pathways responsible for coupling metabolic MeSHD003463 to the molecular clock are being rapidly uncovered [3-5]. Here we show that MeSHD007328-MeSHD058539 (MeSHD019869)-Forkhead box class O3 (FOXO3) signaling is required for circadian MeSHD010507 in the MeSHD008099 via MeSHD012926 of Clock. Knockdown of FoxO3 dampens circadian amplitude, an effect that is rescued by overexpression of Clock. Subsequently, we show binding of FOXO3 to two Daf-binding MeSHD004602 (DBEs) located in the Clock promoter area, implicating Clock as a transcriptional target of FOXO3. Transcriptional oscillation of both core clock and output MeSHD005796 in the MeSHD008099 of FOXO3-deficient MeSHD051379 is affected, indicating a disrupted hepatic circadian MeSHD010507. Finally, we show that MeSHD007328, a major regulator of FOXO activity [6-9], regulates Clock levels in a MeSHD019869- and FOXO3-dependent manner. Our data point to a key MeSHD012380 of the MeSHD007328-FOXO3-Clock signaling pathway in the modulation of MeSHD002940.
19565687	Making the transition to MeSHD006738: exploring MeSHD006738 professionals' perspectives.	MeSHD017051 is available for 6 months before MeSHD003643 but the length of MeSHQ000706 varies widely, suggesting that there are different perspectives on the appropriate timing for this transition. This qualitative study explored MeSHD006738 professionals' views on the appropriate timing for and MeSHD003142 about MeSHD006738. MeSHD000884 of team meetings informed the MeSHQ000254 of questions for MeSHD017144 and written follow-up MeSHD011795 with 53 MeSHD006738 professionals. Results suggest timely admissions are situation-specific and involve a terminal MeSHD011379, terminal decline, and a mutual MeSHD032882. Important aspects of MeSHD003142 among MeSHD005190, MeSHD010820, and MeSHD006738 teams are described.
28254586	MeSHD007223 nerve MeSHD014947 induces delayed microglial polarization to the M1 MeSHD010641, and MeSHD015444 reduces delayed MeSHD009437 by modulating microglial activity.	MeSHD009437 is absent in MeSHD007223 and emergent years after MeSHD014947. MeSHD000328 MeSHD013116 MeSHD017628 MeSHD010988 a key MeSHD012380 in initiating MeSHD009437, and modulation of MeSHD017628 is a potential target for treating MeSHD009437. In this study, we evaluated the MeSHD012380 of MeSHD017628 after MeSHD007223 MeSHD059348 and the effect of MeSHD015444 on the delayed-onset MeSHD009437. MeSHD051381 pups received spared nerve MeSHD014947, and MeSHD000067290 were performed to evaluate their MeSHD017288. qPCR, MeSHD007150, and MeSHD015153 were used for M1 and M2 marker expression MeSHQ000032. In contrast to the microglial polarization to the M1 MeSHD010641 observed in the MeSHD000328 MeSHD013116, in MeSHD007223 nerve MeSHD014947, microglial polarization immediately shifted to the M2 MeSHD010641. In MeSHD000293, MeSHD017628 polarized to the M1 MeSHD010641, which was concomitant with the emergence of MeSHD009437. MeSHD015444 shifted MeSHD013116 MeSHD017628 polarization to the M2 MeSHD010641 and reduced MeSHD009437. In addition, MeSHD016753 increased and TNF-α decreased after MeSHD015444, and MeSHD007278 of the MeSHD016753 antibody reduced the MeSHD015444-induced MeSHD000698. Our study found that MeSHD007223 nerve MeSHD014947 induced delayed MeSHD013116 MeSHD017628 polarization to the M1 MeSHD010641 and that MeSHD015444 was effective in the MeSHQ000628 of delayed MeSHD000293 MeSHD009437 via the modulation of microglial polarization.
26198962	[MeSHD015415 MeSHQ000175 during the MeSHD011262 for MeSHD011296 and predicting MeSHD011256].	To explore the clinical value of MeSHQ000175 the MeSHD015415 during the MeSHD011262 of MeSHD011247 in preventing MeSHQ000151 MeSHD000013 and predicting the MeSHD011256. Between November, 2011 and October, 2013, a total of 25 520 MeSHD037841 (15-20+6 gestational weeks) underwent a MeSHQ000175 test of triple MeSHD015415 including free beta-MeSHD006801 chorionic gonadotrophin (free βhCG), MeSHD000509 (AFP), and unconjugated MeSHD004964 (µE3) during the second semester of MeSHD011247. The MeSHD014930 identified by the MeSHQ000175 test as having high MeSHD012306 were referred to invasive MeSHD011296 by MeSHD000649, or to MeSHD003116 MeSHD018608 examination for suspected MeSHD020490 MeSHD009436 (NTD), and their MeSHD011256 were followed up. MeSHD018566 were identified by the MeSHQ000175 test in 4.91% (1254/25520) of the total cohort. Of the 818 MeSHD010361 receiving invasive MeSHD011296, the abnormal rate was 5.75% (47/818). The MeSHD018566 identified by the MeSHQ000175 test was associated with a significantly higher rate of abnormal outcomes compared with the low-MeSHD012306 MeSHD011247 (1.91% vs 0.1%, P<0.01). Of the 210 high-MeSHD012306 cases of NTD, a definite MeSHD003933 was established in 34 cases. We also found that MeSHD011247 at an advanced age (>35 years) was associated with increased MeSHD012306 for MeSHD004314 compared with those at younger ages (15% vs 1.65%P<0.01). The detection rate of MeSHD059786 in MeSHD011247 with an abnormal MoM value of a single marker was 3.17% (6/189). MeSHQ000175 tests of MeSHD015415 during the MeSHD011262 of MeSHD011247 can be helpful to identify fetal chromosomal and anatomical MeSHQ000002, predict unfavorable MeSHD011256, and prevent MeSHQ000002 in MeSHD011247 at an advanced age. The MoM value of a single marker in the MeSHD011262 can be indicative of potential MeSHD002869.
28935236	Effectiveness of MeSHD007252 in preventing severe MeSHD007251 illness among MeSHD000328: A MeSHD000078182 and MeSHD017418 of test-negative design MeSHD016022.	Summary evidence of MeSHD007252 effectiveness (IVE) against hospitalized MeSHD007251 is lacking. We conducted a MeSHD017418 of studies reporting IVE against MeSHD007753-confirmed hospitalized MeSHD007251 among MeSHD000328. We searched Pubmed (January 2009 to November 2016) for studies that used test-negative design (TND) to enrol MeSHD010361 hospitalized with MeSHD007251-MeSHQ000150. Two independent authors selected relevant articles. We calculated pooled IVE against any and (sub)type specific MeSHD007251 among all MeSHD000328, and stratified by MeSHD009273 (18-64 and 65 years and above) using random-effects models. We identified 3411 MeSHD011642 and 30 met our inclusion MeSHQ000592. Between 2010-11 and 2014-15, the pooled seasonal IVE was 41% (95%CI:34;48) for any MeSHD007251 (51% (95%CI:44;58) among people MeSHD000368 18-64y and 37% (95%CI:30;44) among ≥65 years). IVE was 48% (95%CI:37;59),37% (95%CI:24;50) and 38% (95%CI:23;53) against MeSHD007251 A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B, respectively. Among MeSHD009272 MeSHD000368 ≥65 year, IVE against A(H3N2) was 43% (95%CI:33;53) in MeSHD012621 when circulating and MeSHD014612 MeSHD013180 were antigenically similar and 14% (95%CI:-3;30) when A(H3N2) variant MeSHD014780 predominated. MeSHD007252 provided moderate protection against MeSHD007251-associated MeSHD006760 among MeSHD000328. They seemed to provide low protection among MeSHD000368 in MeSHD012621 where MeSHD014612 and circulating A(H3N2) MeSHD013180 were antigenically variant.
22808189	MeSHD018088 in admitted MeSHD010361 at a MeSHD062606 of MeSHD001459.	This study was set out to investigate the magnitude, patterns and molecular characterization of MeSHD004364-resistant MeSHD009169 MeSHD013180 at a MeSHD062606 in MeSHD001459. MeSHD014397 (TB) MeSHD010361 admitted at National Institute of MeSHD004194 of the MeSHD013909 and MeSHD006761 from February 2002 to September 2005 with or without previous MeSHQ000266 of TB and/or other MeSHQ000150 were randomly interviewed. Among 265 participants enrolled, M. MeSHD014376 isolates from 189 MeSHD010361 were finally tested for susceptibility to MeSHD012293 (RMP), MeSHD007538 (INH), MeSHD004977 (ETM) and MeSHD013307 (STM). Genotyping of M. MeSHD014376 was done using deletion MeSHQ000032 and spoligotyping. Eighty-eight percent (n = 167) of the MeSHD010361 had MeSHQ000266 of previous anti-TB MeSHQ000628 while the remaining 12% were new TB cases. Of the 189 isolates, 9% were fully susceptible to the first line anti-TB MeSHD004364 and 73.5% were multi-MeSHD004364 resistant TB. Other susceptibility results showed 79.4%, 77.2%, 76.7% and 78.8% resistance to INH, RMP, ETM and STM respectively. MeSHD018432 was significantly higher among the 130 (78%) MeSHD010361 with previous MeSHQ000266 of anti-MeSHD014376 MeSHQ000628 (95% MeSHD016001, p = 0.001). Among the 189 analyzed isolates, 69% were classified as "modern" M. MeSHD014376 MeSHD013180 (i.e. TbD1- MeSHD013180, lacking the M. MeSHD014376-deletion region TbD1), whereas the remaining 31% were found to belong to the "ancestal" TbD1+ M. MeSHD014376 lineages. One hundred and five different spoligotype patterns were identified in which 16 clusters contained 100 MeSHD013180 and 89 MeSHD013180 had unique pattern. MeSHD013180 with a spoligotype characteristic for the "MeSHD000068476" cluster were predominant (19%) and most of these MeSHD013180 (75%) were multi-MeSHD004364 resistant (MDR). A high level of MeSHD004351 observed among the re-MeSHQ000628 MeSHD010361 poses a threat of MeSHQ000635 of resistant MeSHD013180 to susceptible MeSHD009272 in the MeSHD012111. Proper MeSHD003376 of MeSHD010361 and MeSHD001288 towards the completion of the anti-TB MeSHQ000628 is needed.
27410392	MeSHD003668 healing with an intensive nutrition intervention in an acute setting: a MeSHD000070356 randomised controlled trial.	To investigate the feasibility of recruitment, retention, intervention delivery and outcome measurement in a nutritional intervention to promote MeSHD003668 healing in an acute setting. Some 50 MeSHD062606 MeSHD010361 with stage II or greater MeSHD003668 were randomised to receive either individualised nutritional care by a MeSHD064686, including MeSHD055656 of MeSHD014945 supplements; or standard nutritional care. Relevant nutritional and MeSHD003668 (PU) parameters were collected at day 5, 10, 15, 22 and then weekly or until discharge. The median length of MeSHD007902 was 14 days (1-70) with 29 MeSHD010361 discharged by day 15. There were 24 MeSHD010361 discharged before their PU fully healed. Per cent change in valid PU area and score MeSHD014894 from baseline to day 15 were chosen for outcome MeSHD000078332 to account for varying initial size and severity of the MeSHD014947 and MeSHD007902. There was a larger percentage reduction in PU MeSHD014894 in the intervention group, but this was not statistically significant. Little difference was found in MeSHD004435 between the MeSHQ000517 and intervention groups indicating a requirement to focus on effective delivery of the intervention in MeSHD005544 studies. MeSHD005544 studies in the acute setting need to account for MeSHD007902 and ideally follow MeSHD010361 until full healing. Results indicate a positive MeSHD001244 with nutrition intervention and PU healing and that a rigorously designed and adequately powered study is feasible. DECLARATION OF INTEREST: This MeSHD012106 was supported by a MeSHD005381 from the MeSHD011793 MeSHD006262, MeSHD006262 Practitioner MeSHD012106 Scheme. The authors have no MeSHD016265 to declare.
24011341	Ultrastructural changes of MeSHD012441 in response to MeSHD000431 stress.	In the fermentative process using MeSHD012441 to produce bioethanol, the performance of MeSHD002477 is often compromised by the accumulation of MeSHD000431. However, the mechanism of how MeSHD012441 responds against MeSHD000431 stress remains elusive. In the current study, MeSHD012441 MeSHD002477 were cultured in YPD (MeSHD015003 extract - MeSHD010461 - MeSHD005947) medium containing various concentrations of MeSHD000431 (0%, 2.5%, 5%, 7.5%, 10%, and 15% (v/v)). Compared with the MeSHD035061 without MeSHD000431, the MeSHD004909 of MeSHD012441 decreased significantly in the presence of 7.5% and 10% MeSHD000431 after incubation for 16 h (P < 0.05), and in the presence of 15% MeSHD000431 at all 3 sampling MeSHD013995 points (1, 8, and 16 h) (P < 0.05). The exposure of MeSHD012441 MeSHD002477 to MeSHD000431 also led to an increase in MeSHD008315 content (P < 0.05) and a decrease in sulfhydryl group content (P < 0.05). Moreover, the MeSHD019370 through MeSHD046529 enabled us to relate ultrastructural changes elicited by MeSHD000431 with the cellular stress MeSHQ000502. Under MeSHD000431 stress, the integrity of the MeSHD002462 was compromised. The swelling or distortion of MeSHD008928 together with the MeSHQ000453 of a single and large MeSHD014617 was correlated with the addition of MeSHD000431. These results suggested that the MeSHD002462 is one of the targets of MeSHD000431, and the degeneration of MeSHD008928 promoted the accumulation of intracellular MeSHD017382.
20099119	Nonclinical MeSHD012449 assessment of MeSHD014612 and adjuvants.	To ensure the safe MeSHD009934 of MeSHD014612 to MeSHD006801, MeSHD014612 (just like any new chemical entity) are evaluated in a series of nonclinical MeSHD012449 assessment studies that aim at identifying the potential MeSHQ000633 associated with their MeSHD009934. The nonclinical MeSHD012449 assessment of MeSHD014612, however, is only part of a testing battery performed prior to MeSHD006801 MeSHD009934, which includes (1) the evaluation of the MeSHD014612 in efficacy and immunogenicity studies in MeSHD023421, (2) a MeSHD011786 testing MeSHD019542, and (3) MeSHD014116 (nonclinical MeSHD012449 assessment) testing in relevant MeSHD023421. Although each of these evaluations MeSHD010988 a critical MeSHD012380 in ensuring MeSHD014612 MeSHD012449, the nonclinical MeSHD012449 assessment is the most relevant to the evaluation in MeSHD006801 MeSHD016430, as it allows the identification of potential MeSHQ000633 to be monitored in MeSHD006801 trials, and in some cases, eliminates candidates that have unacceptable MeSHD012306 for MeSHD006801 testing. This MeSHD016454 summarizes the requirements for the nonclinical testing of MeSHD014612 and adjuvants needed in support of all phases of MeSHD006801 MeSHD016430.
21507555	Characterization of MeSHD058441 MeSHQ000382 for MeSHQ000517 of phytopathogenic MeSHD005658 of MeSHD018551.	Fluorescent MeSHD011549 spp., isolated from MeSHD058441 MeSHD012987 of MeSHD018551 and pepper MeSHD010944, were evaluated MeSHD066298 as potential MeSHQ000037 of fungal pathogens. MeSHD013180 were characterized using the API 20NE biochemical system, and tested against the causal agents of stem canker and leaf blight (MeSHC000660246 f. sp. lycopersici), southern blight (MeSHC000662920 Sacc.), and root rot (MeSHC000672223). To this end, dual MeSHQ000208 antagonism assays were carried out on 25% Tryptic Soy MeSHD000362, King B medium, and MeSHD011198 MeSHD005947 MeSHD000362 to determine the effect of the MeSHD013180 on mycelial MeSHQ000254 of the pathogens. The effect of two concentrations of FeCl(3) on antagonism against MeSHC000660246 f. sp. lycopersici was also tested. In addition, MeSHD013180 were screened for MeSHD001076 to produce exoenzymes and MeSHD017262. Finally, the selected MeSHD011549 MeSHD013180, PCI2, was evaluated for effect on MeSHD018551 MeSHD036226 MeSHQ000254 and as a potential candidate for controlling MeSHD018551 damping-off caused by MeSHC000662920 Sacc., under MeSHQ000254 chamber conditions. All MeSHD013180 significantly inhibited MeSHC000660246 f. sp. lycopersici, particularly in 25% MeSHC481298 medium. Antagonistic effect on MeSHC000662920 Sacc. and MeSHC000672223 was greater on King B medium. MeSHD010447 was produced by 30% of the MeSHD013180, but no MeSHD013180 produced MeSHD002480 or MeSHD002688. MeSHQ000254 chamber studies resulted in significant increases in MeSHD010944 stand as well as in root dry weight. PCI2 was able to establish and survive in MeSHD018551 MeSHD010944 MeSHD058441 after 40 days following planting of bacterized MeSHD012639.
25342742	Activation of MeSHD005910 MeSHD002477 generates immune tolerant MeSHD055611.	MeSHD013812 outcomes of MeSHD005910 are currently not encouraging. MeSHD009369 tolerance MeSHD010988 an important MeSHD012380 in the MeSHQ000209 of MeSHD005910. It is reported that MeSHD035683 (miR) are associated with MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254. This study aims to investigate the MeSHD012380 of miR-92a in the MeSHQ000254 of tolerant natural killer T (NKT) MeSHD002477. In this study, U87 MeSHD002477 (a MeSHD006801 MeSHD005910 MeSHD002460) and primary MeSHD005910 MeSHD002477 were prepared. The assessment of miR-92a was performed by real MeSHD013995 RT-MeSHD016133. The expression of MeSHD007378 (IL)-10 and MeSHD015850 in MeSHD055611 was evaluated by MeSHD005434. Results showed that abundant MeSHD015850(+) MeSHD016753(+) MeSHD055611 were detected in MeSHD005910 MeSHD014024. MeSHQ000208 of MeSHD005910 MeSHD002477 and MeSHD055611 induced the expression of MeSHD015850 and MeSHD016753 in MeSHD055611. MeSHD005910 MeSHD002477 expressed miR-92a; the latter played a critical MeSHD012380 in the induction of MeSHD015850 and MeSHD016753 expression in MeSHD055611. The expression of the antitumor molecules, including MeSHD054353, MeSHD053222, and MeSHD007372-γ, was significantly attenuated compared with MeSHQ000517 MeSHD055611. The MeSHD015850(+) MeSHD016753(+) MeSHD055611 showed less capability in the induction of MeSHD017209 in MeSHD005910 MeSHD002477, but showed the immune suppressor MeSHQ000502 on CD8(+) MeSHD013601 activities. We conclude that MeSHD005910-derived miR-92a induces MeSHD015850(+) MeSHD016753(+) MeSHD055611; this fraction of MeSHD055611 can suppress cytotoxic CD8(+) MeSHD013601.
27411057	In planta Transformed MeSHD028527 (MeSHD028527 L.) MeSHD010944, Overexpressing the SbNHX1 MeSHD005796 Showed Enhanced MeSHD012492 Endurance.	MeSHD028527 is an annual, herbaceous, medicinal, aromatic, MeSHD017365 glycophyte that contains diverse applications as a MeSHD005502 and flavoring additive, and MeSHD013812 agents. An efficient, less MeSHD013995 consuming, MeSHD060054-mediated, a MeSHD014024 MeSHQ000208-independent in planta MeSHD014170 MeSHD008722 was established for the first MeSHD013995 using MeSHD028527 MeSHD012639. The SbNHX1 MeSHD005796, cloned from an extreme MeSHD055051 MeSHD019663 brachiata was transformed in MeSHD028527 using optimized in planta transformation MeSHD008722. The SbNHX1 MeSHD005796 encodes a vacuolar Na+/H+ MeSHD017920 and is involved in the compartmentalization of excess Na+ MeSHD007477 into the MeSHD014617 and MeSHD008283 of ion MeSHD006706 Transgenic MeSHD028527 MeSHD010944 were confirmed by MeSHD016133 using MeSHD005796 (SbNHX1, uidA and hptII) specific primers. The single MeSHD005796 integration event and overexpression of the MeSHD005796 were confirmed by Southern hybridization and competitive RT-MeSHD016133, respectively. Transgenic lines MeSHC010200 and L13 showed high expression of the SbNHX1 MeSHD005796 compared to L6 whereas moderate expression was detected in L5 and L10 transgenic lines. Transgenic lines (MeSHC010200, L5, L10 and L13), overexpressing the SbNHX1 MeSHD005796, showed higher photosynthetic pigments (MeSHD002734 a, b and MeSHD002338), and lower electrolytic leakage, MeSHD015227 (MDA content) and MeSHD011392 content as compared to wild type MeSHD010944 under MeSHD000077323. Though transgenic lines were also affected by MeSHD000077323 but performed better compared to WT MeSHD010944. The MeSHD000066630 of the SbNHX1 MeSHD005796 confirmed enhanced MeSHD000077323 tolerance in MeSHD028527 as compared to wild type MeSHD010944 under stress condition. The present study is the first MeSHD058028 of MeSHD004738 MeSHD055049 in MeSHD028527, so far and the MeSHD010944 may be utilized for the cultivation in saline areas.
28188532	Pathway-Informed Discovery and Targeted Proteomic MeSHD057188 Using MeSHD013058.	Recent advancements in MeSHD013058 (MS) and MeSHD000078332 MeSHD012984 have enabled new strategies for MeSHD001688 discovery using MeSHD040901. MeSHD040901 has evolved from routine discovery and identification of MeSHD011506 to integrated multi-omics projects relating specific MeSHD011506 to their MeSHD005796 and metabolites. Using additional information, such as that contained in MeSHD001688 pathways, has enabled the MeSHQ000706 of targeted MeSHD011506 quantitation for monitoring fold changes in expression as well as MeSHD015415 discovery. Here we discuss a full proteomic MeSHD057188 from discovery MeSHD040901 on a quadrupole MeSHD013995-of-Flight (Q-TOF) MS to targeted MeSHD040901 using a triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS. A discovery MeSHD040901 MeSHD057188 encompassing acquisition of data-dependent MeSHD040901 data on a Q-TOF and MeSHD030562 searching MeSHD014836 be described which MeSHQ000706 the MeSHD011506 abundances from identified MeSHD011506 for subsequent statistical MeSHQ000032 and pathway visualization. From the active pathways, a MeSHD011506 target list is created for MeSHQ000706 in a MeSHD010455-based QQQ MeSHQ000032. These MeSHD010455 are used as surrogates for target MeSHD011506 quantitation. MeSHD010455-based QQQ assays provide MeSHD012680 and selectivity allowing rapid and robust MeSHQ000032 of large batches of samples. These quantitative results are then statistically compared and visualized on the original MeSHD001688 pathways with a more complete coverage of MeSHD011506 in the studied pathways.
17977838	Novel MeSHD012380 in MeSHD006801 MD-2 of MeSHD010649 121 and 126 and MeSHD014443 131 in activation of MeSHD051197 by MeSHD004731.	Potent mammalian MeSHD002477 activation by Gram-negative bacterial MeSHD004731 requires sequential MeSHD011506-MeSHD004731 and MeSHD011506-MeSHD011506 interactions involving MeSHC061257, CD14, MD-2, and MeSHD051197 (TLR4). TLR4 activation requires simultaneous binding of MD-2 to MeSHD004731 (E) and the ectodomain of TLR4. We now describe mutants of recombinant MeSHD006801 MD-2 that bind TLR4 and react with E.CD14 but do not support cellular responsiveness to MeSHD004731. The mutants F121A/K122A MD-2 and Y131A/K132A MD-2 react with E.CD14 only when co-expressed with TLR4. Single mutants K122A and K132A each react with E.CD14 +/- TLR4 and promote TLR4-dependent MeSHD002477 activation by MeSHD004731 suggesting that Phe(121) and Tyr(131) are needed for TLR4-independent transfer of MeSHD004731 from CD14 to MD-2 and also needed for TLR4 activation by bound E.MD-2. The mutant F126A MD-2 reacts as well as wild-type MD-2 with E.CD14 +/- TLR4. E.MD-2(F126A) binds TLR4 with high affinity (K(d) approximately 200 pm) but does not activate TLR4 and instead acts as a potent TLR4 antagonist, inhibiting activation of HEK/TLR4 MeSHD002477 by wild-type E.MD-2. These MeSHQ000175 reveal MeSHD012380 of Phe(121) and Tyr(131) in TLR4-independent interactions of MeSHD006801 MD-2 with E.CD14 and, together with Phe(126), in activation of TLR4 by bound E.MD-2. These MeSHQ000175 strongly suggest that the structural properties of E.MD-2, not E alone, determine agonist or antagonist effects on TLR4.
28503822	Constitutional MeSHC536928 in a healthy MeSHD002648: On the spot MeSHD003933?	Constitutional MeSHC536928 (CMMRD) is a rare, recessively inherited childhood MeSHD009369 predisposition MeSHD013577 caused by biallelic MeSHD018095 in one of the MeSHD053843 MeSHD005796. The CMMRD MeSHD010641 overlaps with that of MeSHD009456 (NF1), since many MeSHD010361 have multiple café-au-lait macules (CALM) and other NF1 MeSHQ000175, but no MeSHD005854 NF1 MeSHD009154. We MeSHD058028 of a case of a healthy 6-year-old MeSHD014930 who fulfilled the diagnostic MeSHQ000592 of NF1 with >6 CALM and freckling. Since MeSHD008967 testing was unable to confirm the MeSHD003933 of NF1 or MeSHC548032 and the MeSHD010361 was a MeSHD002648 of consanguineous MeSHD010290, we suspected CMMRD and found a homozygous PMS2 MeSHD009154 that impairs MMR MeSHQ000502. Current MeSHQ000592 advise testing for CMMRD only in MeSHD009369 MeSHD010361. However, this case illustrates that including CMMRD in the MeSHD003937 in suspected sporadic NF1 without causative NF1 or SPRED1 MeSHD009154 may facilitate identification of CMMRD prior to MeSHD009369 MeSHQ000254. We discuss the advantages and potential MeSHD012306 of this CMMRD testing scenario.
19586833	Construction of balanced translocation t(1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) probe and MeSHQ000175 application in genomic samples in MeSHD013624.	The disrupted-in-MeSHD012559 1 (DISC1) MeSHD005796 is a candidate MeSHD005796 in MeSHD012559. The balanced t(1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) translocation with a breakpoint between MeSHD005091 8 and 9 of DISC1 has been found to be co-segregated with MeSHD011618 in a Scottish MeSHD005190. To examine whether the t(1;11)(q42.1;q14.3) translocation exists in Taiwanese samples, we constructed a MeSHD010957 probe that carried the two MeSHD004247 fragments of MeSHD002878 (738 bp) and MeSHD002880 (719 bp) that covered the breakpoint. This probe was validated using a derived MeSHD004247 gift from the translocation carrier of the Scottish MeSHD005190. We screened genomic MeSHD004247 samples from 619 subjects (507 cases and 112 MeSHQ000517). None of the subjects showed the designed MeSHD016133 (MeSHD016133) product detected by the probe. We concluded that the significant MeSHD001244 between MeSHD012559 and the DISC1 MeSHD005796 in the Taiwanese sample was not caused by balance translocation, but rather by polymorphic variations of the MeSHD005796 to be detected.
19072762	Repair of MeSHD004247 lesions associated with triplex-forming MeSHD009841.	Triplex-forming MeSHD009841 (TFOs) are MeSHD018390 tools that can bind in the major groove of duplex MeSHD004247 in a sequence-specific manner. When bound to MeSHD004247, TFOs can inhibit MeSHD015870, can position MeSHD004247-reactive agents to specific locations in the MeSHD016678, or can induce targeted MeSHD016296 and MeSHD011995. There is evidence that third strand binding, alone or with an associated cross-link, is recognized and metabolized by MeSHD004260 factors, particularly the MeSHD004260 pathway. This MeSHD016454 examines the evidence for MeSHD004260 of triplex-associated lesions.
18337557	MeSHD035683 expression profiling in relation to the MeSHD018740 of MeSHD015470.	MeSHD015470 (AML) is a highly diverse MeSHD004194 characterized by various MeSHD003582 and molecular MeSHQ000002. MeSHD035683 are MeSHD058727 that show variable expression during myeloid differentiation. MeSHD035683 expression in MeSHD001853 blasts in 215 cases of newly diagnosed and (cyto)genetically defined AML was assessed using quantitative MeSHD048348-MeSHD016133 (RT-MeSHD016133) for 260 MeSHD006801 MeSHD035683. In the same series, MeSHD012333 MeSHD059467 were established, allowing a direct comparison between MeSHD035683 and MeSHD012333 expression. We show that MeSHD035683 expression profiling following unsupervised MeSHQ000032 reveals distinctive MeSHD035683 signatures that correlate with MeSHD003582 and molecular subtypes of AML (ie, AMLs with t(8;21), t(15;17), inv(16), NPM1, and CEBPA MeSHD009154). Significantly differentially expressed MeSHD035683 for genetic subtypes of AML were identified. Specific MeSHD035683 with established oncogenic and MeSHD009369 suppressor MeSHQ000502, such as MeSHD035683-155, MeSHD035683-21, and let-7, appear to be associated with particular subtypes. Combinations of selected sets of MeSHD035683 could predict cytogenetically normal AML with MeSHD009154 in the MeSHD005796 of NPM1 and CEBPA and FLT3-ITD with similar accuracy as MeSHD012333 probe set combinations defined by MeSHD020869. MeSHD035683 expression apparently MeSHD001503 specific relationships to the heterogeneous pathobiology of AML. Distinctive MeSHD035683 signatures appear of potential value in the clinical MeSHD003933 of AML.
28513457	MeSHD001430 from MeSHD056546 as an alternative to MeSHD000900.	MeSHD001430 are ribosomally synthesized, proteinaceous substances that inhibit the MeSHQ000254 of closely related species through numerous mechanisms. The MeSHD002965 system used in this MeSHD016454 divided MeSHD001430 into four sub-groups based on their size. Currently, there is extensive MeSHD012106 focused on MeSHD001430 and their usage as a MeSHD005502 preservative. The increasing MeSHD015994 of multidrug resistant bacterial pathogens is one of the most pressing medical problems in recent years. Recently, the potential clinical application of LAB (MeSHD056546) MeSHD001430 has been the subject of investigations by many scientists. MeSHD001430 can be considered in a sense as MeSHD000900, although they differ from conventional MeSHD000900 in numerous aspects. The MeSHD005796-encoded MeSHD019368 of MeSHD001430 makes them easily amenable through MeSHD057005 to either increase their activity or specify target microorganism. Owing to this feature of MeSHD001430, MeSHD000900 MeSHQ000628 would become less damaging to the natural MeSHD000069196, which is a common drawback of conventional MeSHD000900 MeSHQ000706. MeSHD001430 from MeSHD056546 represent one of the most studied microbial defense systems and the idea of subjecting them to MeSHD057005 to either increase antimicrobial activity or further specify their target microorganism is now a rapidly expanding field. This MeSHD016454 aimed to present MeSHD001430 as a possible alternative to conventional MeSHD000900 basic on latest scientific data.
19074074	The MeSHD012926 of MeSHD064451 and its effects on systemic and cellular MeSHD007501 MeSHQ000378.	Systemic MeSHD007501 MeSHD006706 depends on the regulated expression of MeSHD064451, a MeSHD036361 that negatively regulates MeSHD007501 egress from intestinal MeSHD002477 and MeSHD008264 by altering the expression of the cellular MeSHD007501 exporter MeSHC409881. In doing so, MeSHD064451 can MeSHQ000517 both the total body MeSHD007501 by modulating intestinal MeSHD007501 MeSHD000042 as well as promote MeSHD007501 available for MeSHD004920 by affecting the MeSHD004526 with which MeSHD008264 recycle MeSHD007501 from effete MeSHD004912. This MeSHD016454 focuses on the systemic and cellular MeSHQ000502 of MeSHD064451 MeSHD012926 in relation to MeSHD007501 stores, MeSHD004920, MeSHD007249, and MeSHD000860 and how MeSHD064451 MeSHD012926 and dysregulation contributes to normal MeSHD007501 MeSHD006706 and MeSHD019189.
26480046	MeSHD006262 and Welfare in Dutch Organic Laying Hens.	From 2007-2008, data on MeSHD000818 MeSHD006262 and welfare and MeSHD000072480 management during rearing and laying periods were collected from 49 flocks of organic laying hens in the MeSHD009426. Our aim was to investigate how organic MeSHD010063 MeSHD000072480 performed in terms of MeSHD000818 MeSHD006262 and welfare and which MeSHD000072480 factors affected this performance. The flocks in our study were kept on MeSHD000072480 with 34 to 25,000 hens (average 9,300 hens). Seventy-one percent of the flocks consisted of 'MeSHD012834 MeSHD002678': MeSHD044465 hens that lay brown MeSHD010063. Fifty-five percent of the flocks were kept in MeSHD005430-based MeSHD006798 and 45% of the flocks in aviaries. No relation was found between the amount of MeSHD013995 spent outdoors during the laying period and MeSHD009026 at 60 weeks. Flocks that used their outdoor run more intensively had better MeSHD005241 scores. In 40% of the flocks there was MeSHD009026 caused by predators. The average MeSHD004435 was 129 g/day at 30 weeks and 133 g/day at 60 weeks of age. The average percentage of mislaid MeSHD010063 decreased from three at 30 weeks to two at 60 weeks. The average MeSHD009026 was 7.8% at 60 weeks. Twenty-five percent of the flocks were not treated for worms in their first 50 weeks. Flubenol(©) was applied to the flocks that were treated. Ten percent of the flocks followed Flubenol(©) MeSHD019514 for MeSHQ000706 and were wormed five or more MeSHD013995. The other 65% percent were treated irregularly between one and four MeSHD013995. Sixty-eight percent of the flocks showed little or no MeSHD005241 damage, 24% showed moderate damage and 8% showed severe damage. The MeSHD005241 score was better if the hens used the free-range area more intensely, the laying percentage at 60 weeks was higher, and if they were allowed to go outside sooner after arrival on the laying MeSHD000072480. In 69% of the flocks, hens had peck MeSHQ000293 in the vent area: on average this was 18% of the hens. Keel MeSHD001842 deformations were found in all flocks, on average in 21% of the MeSHD001717. In 78% of the flocks, an average of 13% of the hens had MeSHD005528-sole MeSHQ000293, mostly a small crust. MeSHD003129 were darker in flocks that used the range area more intensively. More fearful flocks had lighter MeSHD003129. We conclude that MeSHD058871 are potentially more MeSHD000818 friendly than other MeSHD011200 systems based on the MeSHD000827 benefits of the free range areas. However, we also observed MeSHD009026, internal MeSHQ000469, keel MeSHD001842 MeSHQ000002, and MeSHD005528 sole lesions on MeSHD058871 that were comparable to or worse than in other husbandry systems. It is unclear whether these 'remaining' problems can be attributed to MeSHD006798 or if they are the result of keeping high productive MeSHD005838 in an artificial MeSHD004777. MeSHD058871 MeSHQ000706 the same high productive MeSHD005838 as other husbandry systems.
27968998	The arbuscular mycorrhizal MeSHD005658 MeSHC000681833 differentially regulates the MeSHD003300 response of two MeSHD003313 cultivars differing in MeSHD003300 tolerance.	Arbuscular MeSHD038821 can increase MeSHD010944 tolerance to MeSHD019216. The effects of arbuscular MeSHD038821 on MeSHD010944 MeSHD008670 tolerance vary depending on the fungal and MeSHD010944 species involved. Here, we MeSHD058028 the effect of the arbuscular mycorrhizal MeSHD005658 MeSHC000681833 on the physiological and biochemical responses to Cu of two MeSHD003313 MeSHD005838 differing in Cu tolerance, the Cu-sensitive cv. Orense and the Cu-tolerant cv. Oropesa. MeSHQ000254 of the MeSHD013559 MeSHC020416 an increased Cu tolerance to cv. Orense. Root and shoot Cu concentrations were lower in mycorrhizal than in non-mycorrhizal MeSHD010944 of both cultivars. Shoot MeSHD015227 increased with MeSHD012987 Cu content only in non-mycorrhizal MeSHD010944 of the Cu-sensitive cultivar. Root MeSHD015227 increased with MeSHD012987 Cu content, except in mycorrhizal MeSHD010944 grown at 250mg Cu kg-1soil. In shoots of mycorrhizal MeSHD010944 of both cultivars, MeSHD013482, MeSHD060387, MeSHD002374 and MeSHD005980 activities were not affected by MeSHD012987 Cu content. In Cu-supplemented MeSHD012987, total MeSHD054811 content increased in shoots of mycorrhizal cv. Orense but decreased in cv. Oropesa. MeSHD016424, these data suggest that the increased Cu tolerance of mycorrhizal MeSHD010944 of cv. Orense could be due to an increased induction of shoot MeSHD054811 MeSHQ000096 by the MeSHD013559 in this cultivar.
23888933	Blue-MeSHD008027-induced PIN3 polarization for root negative phototropic response in MeSHD017360.	Root negative MeSHD018524 is an important response in MeSHD010944. Although blue MeSHD008027 is known to mediate this response, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying root negative MeSHD018524 remain unclear. Here, we MeSHD058028 that the MeSHD007210 efflux carrier PIN-FORMED (PIN) 3 is involved in asymmetric MeSHD007210 MeSHQ000600 and root negative MeSHD018524. Unilateral blue-MeSHD008027 MeSHD008029 polarized PIN3 to the outer lateral MeSHD008566 of columella MeSHD002477 at the illuminated root side, and increased MeSHD007210 activity at the illuminated side of roots, where MeSHD007210 promotes MeSHQ000254 and MeSHQ000209 roots bending away from the MeSHD008027 source. Furthermore, root negative phototropic response and blue-MeSHD008027-induced PIN3 polarization were modulated by a MeSHD020126-sensitive, GNOM-dependent, trafficking pathway and by phot1-regulated PINOID (PID)/PROTEIN PHOSPHATASE 2A (PP2A) activity. Our results indicate that blue-MeSHD008027-induced PIN3 polarization is needed for asymmetric MeSHD007210 MeSHQ000600 during root negative phototropic response.
28180272	MeSHD010465 of success of a local UK MeSHD011634 collaborative†.	Successful MeSHD011634 initiatives require multi-sector collaboration. AVONet was a UK collaborative developed to provide evidence-based strategies for active ageing. This study explored the success of AVONet in the MeSHD000124 of its objectives as perceived by all partners. A convergent parallel mixed-MeSHQ000379 design was employed, utilizing a quantitative MeSHD011795 and qualitative semi-structured MeSHD017203. MeSHD003625 was undertaken in September 2010, 18 months after establishing the collaborative and 6 months after MeSHQ000191 had ceased. AVONet partners (n = 24) completed a 27-item MeSHD011795. A sub-sample of four academics and four practitioners participated in semi-structured MeSHD017203. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons were made between academics' and practitioners' MeSHD010465 of success, potential for sustainability and MeSHD010549 with structure and relationships. Participants perceived the AVONet collaborative positively. Significant between-group (academic v practitioner) differences in MeSHD011795 responses were observed for success (U = 19.5; p = 0.003) and structure (U = 125.5; p = 0.001). Strong positive correlations were observed between success and structure and balance between information transfer and exchange (r = 0.756; p < 0.001). MeSHD017203 confirmed positive MeSHD010465 and perceived importance of the collaborative and highlighted the need for further integration and tangible outcomes for practitioners. MeSHD013404 to enhance sustainability were provided, such as smaller working groups and local council-led governance. Perceived success in building a multi-sectoral collaborative can be achieved during a 10-month period, despite differing MeSHD006301 of contributors. For collaboratives developed as a result of external MeSHQ000191 aimed primarily at facilitating MeSHD012106, involvement of practitioners at an early stage may help set more comprehensive MeSHD006040, supportive MeSHD003142 strategies, and increase potential for sustainability.
21810462	Inhibitory effects of MeSHD044647 polycystum on MeSHD014442 activity and MeSHD008543 formation in B16F10 MeSHD051189 MeSHD008545 MeSHD002477.	MeSHD044647 polycystum, a type of brown MeSHD012624, has been used for the MeSHQ000628 of MeSHD012867-related disorders in MeSHD008519. The aim of the present study is to investigate the antimelanogenesis effect of MeSHD044647 polycystum extracts by MeSHD002477-free MeSHD000363 MeSHD014442 MeSHQ000032 followed by MeSHD002470 MeSHQ000032, cellular MeSHD014442 MeSHQ000032 and MeSHD008543 content MeSHQ000032 using B16F10 MeSHD051189 MeSHD008545 MeSHD002477. MeSHD044647 polycystum was extracted with 95% MeSHD000431 and further fractionated with MeSHD006586, MeSHC007650 and MeSHD014867. The ethanolic MeSHD045424 and its fractionated extracts were tested for their potential to act as antimelanogenesis or MeSHD062327 by their MeSHD001076 to inhibit MeSHD014442 activity in the MeSHD002477-free MeSHD000363 MeSHD014442 MeSHQ000032 and cellular MeSHD014442 derived from MeSHD008543-forming B16F10 MeSHD051189 MeSHD008545 MeSHD002477. The MeSHD014442 inhibitory activity was correlated to the inhibition of MeSHD008543 MeSHD004467 in α-MeSHD009074-stimulated and unstimulated B16F10 MeSHD002477. MeSHD044647 polycystum ethanolic extract and its fractions had little or no inhibitory effect on MeSHD000363 MeSHD014442 activity. However, when tested on cellular MeSHD014442, the ethanolic extract and its non-polar fraction, MeSHD006586 fraction (SPHF), showed significant inhibition of cellular MeSHD014442 activity. In parallel to its cellular MeSHD014442 inhibitory activity, SPHF was also able to inhibit basal and α-MeSHD009074-stimulated MeSHD008543 MeSHD004467 in B16F10 MeSHD002477. Our MeSHQ000175 showed that (i) cellular MeSHD014442 MeSHQ000032 is more reliable than MeSHD000363 MeSHD014442 MeSHQ000032 in the initial testing of potential antimelanogenesis agents and, (ii) SPHF inhibited melanogenesis by inhibiting cellular MeSHD014442 activity. SPHF may be useful for treating MeSHD017495 and as a MeSHD062327 in MeSHD003358 MeSHD007221.
20959685	MeSHD006801 MeSHD004912 as MeSHD053758 carriers for MeSHD008280 particle imaging.	The potential of MeSHD004912 (RBCs) loaded with MeSHD000082662 as a tracer material for MeSHD008280 particle imaging (MPI) has been investigated. MPI is an emerging, quantitative MeSHD003952 modality which holds promise in terms of MeSHD012680 in combination with spatial and temporal resolution. Steady-state and dynamic magnetization measurements, supported by semi-empirical modeling, were employed to analyze the MPI signal generation using RBCs as novel MeSHD032701 constructs. Since the superparamagnetic MeSHC000499 (MeSHC000499) bulk material that is used in this study contains MeSHD053758 with different sizes, it is suggested that during the RBC loading MeSHD008722, a preferential entrapment of MeSHD053758 with MeSHD057446 diameter ≤60 nm occurs by size-selection through the MeSHD004910 pores. This MeSHD000339 the MPI signal of an MeSHD004912-based tracer, compared to bulk. The reduced signal is counterbalanced by a higher in vivo stability of the MeSHC000499-loaded RBCs constructs for MPI applications.
25998828	Lens-based MeSHD005453 nanoscopy.	The majority of studies of the living MeSHD002477 rely on capturing images using MeSHD008856. Unfortunately, for centuries, diffraction of MeSHD008027 was limiting the spatial resolution in the optical microscope: structural and molecular details much finer than about half the wavelength of MeSHD008027 (~200 nm) could not be visualized, imposing significant limitations on this otherwise so promising MeSHD008722. The surpassing of this resolution limit in far-field MeSHD008853 is currently one of the most momentous MeSHQ000254 for studying the living MeSHD002477, as the move from MeSHD008853 to super-resolution MeSHD008853 or 'nanoscopy' offers opportunities to study problems in biophysical and MeSHD035843 at a new level of detail. This MeSHD016454 describes the principles and modalities of present MeSHD005453 nanoscopes, as well as their potential for biophysical and cellular experiments. All the existing nanoscopy variants separate neighboring features by transiently preparing their fluorescent molecules in states of different emission characteristics in order to make the features discernible. Usually these are fluorescent 'on' and 'off' states causing the adjacent molecules to emit sequentially in MeSHD013995. Each of the variants can in principle reach molecular spatial resolution and has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some require specific transitions and states that can be found only in certain fluorophore subfamilies, such as photoswitchable fluorophores, while other variants can be realized with standard fluorescent labels. Similar to conventional far-field MeSHD008853, nanoscopy can be utilized for dynamical, multi-MeSHD003116 and MeSHD021621 of fixed and live MeSHD002477, MeSHD014024 or organisms. Lens-based MeSHD005453 nanoscopy is poised for a high impact on MeSHD005544 MeSHQ000254 in the MeSHD001690, with the potential to help solve long-standing quests in different areas of scientific MeSHD012106.
28099457	Comparing and Evaluating MeSHD054892 Assembly Tools from a Microbiologist's Perspective - Not Only Size Matters!	With the constant improvement in MeSHD003365-MeSHD004526 and quality of MeSHD059014 MeSHD013672, shotgun-sequencing approaches -such as MeSHD056186- have nowadays become the MeSHQ000379 of choice for studying and classifying microorganisms from various MeSHD017753. The MeSHD004467 of data has dramatically increased over the past years and processing and MeSHQ000032 steps are becoming more and more of a bottleneck. Limiting factors are partly the availability of computational MeSHD006295, but mainly the MeSHD019295 expertise in establishing and applying appropriate processing and MeSHQ000032 pipelines. Fortunately, a large diversity of specialized MeSHD012984 is nowadays available. Nevertheless, choosing the most appropriate MeSHQ000379 for answering specific MeSHD001688 questions can be rather challenging, especially for non-bioinformaticians. In order to provide a comprehensive overview and guide for the microbiological scientific MeSHD012111, we assessed the most common and freely available MeSHD054892 assembly tools with MeSHD000078682 to their output MeSHD020500, their MeSHD012680 for low abundant MeSHD012111 members and variability in resulting MeSHD012111 profiles as well as their ease-of-MeSHQ000706. In contrast to the highly anticipated "Critical Assessment of Metagenomic Interpretation" (CAMI) challenge, which MeSHQ000706 general mock MeSHD012111-based assembler comparison we here tested assemblers on real Illumina MeSHD054892 sequencing data from natural MeSHD012111 of varying complexity sampled from MeSHD065928 MeSHD012987 and algal MeSHD018441. Our MeSHD019370 clearly demonstrate that different assembly tools can prove optimal, depending on the sample type, available computational MeSHD006295 and, most importantly, the specific MeSHD012106 MeSHD006040. In addition, we present detailed descriptions of the underlying principles and pitfalls of publically available assembly tools from a microbiologist's perspective, and provide guidance regarding the user-friendliness, MeSHD012680 and reliability of the resulting phylogenetic profiles.
19995872	MeSHD053595-derived L1 overexpressing neural aggregates enhance recovery in Parkinsonian MeSHD051379.	MeSHD010300 is the second most common MeSHD019636, after MeSHD000544, and the most common MeSHD009069. MeSHD004364 MeSHQ000628 and MeSHD046690 can ameliorate MeSHQ000175, but the progressive degeneration of MeSHD059290 in the MeSHD013378 eventually MeSHD007854 to severe motor MeSHQ000503. The MeSHQ000637 of MeSHD013234 has emerged as a promising approach to replace lost MeSHD009474 in order to restore MeSHD004298 levels in the striatum and reactivate functional circuits. We have generated substrate-adherent MeSHD053595-derived neural aggregates overexpressing the MeSHD039842, because it has shown beneficial MeSHQ000502 after MeSHD002490 MeSHD014947. L1 enhances MeSHD000071446 and neuronal migration, differentiation and MeSHD013534 as well as myelination. In a previous study, L1 was shown to enhance functional recovery in a MeSHD051379 model of MeSHD006816. In another study, a new differentiation protocol for MeSHD051189 MeSHD053595 was established allowing the MeSHQ000637 of MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates consisting of differentiated MeSHD009474 and MeSHD063928 into the lesioned MeSHD001921. In the present study, this MeSHD053595 line was engineered to overexpress L1 constitutively at all stages of differentiation and used to generate MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates. These were monitored in their effects on MeSHD013234 MeSHD013534 and differentiation, rescue of endogenous MeSHD059290 and MeSHD001076 to influence functional recovery after MeSHQ000637 in an MeSHD023421 of MeSHD010300. MeSHD005260 C57BL/6J MeSHD051379 (2 months old) were treated with the mitochondrial toxin MeSHD015632 intraperitoneally to deplete MeSHD059290 selectively, followed by unilateral MeSHQ000637 of MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates into the striatum. MeSHD051379 grafted with L1 overexpressing MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates showed better functional recovery when compared to MeSHD051379 transplanted with wild-type MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates and vehicle-injected MeSHD051379. Morphological MeSHQ000032 revealed increased numbers and migration of surviving transplanted MeSHD002477, as well as increased numbers of MeSHD059290, leading to enhanced levels of MeSHD004298 in the striatum ipsilateral to the grafted side in L1 overexpressing MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates, when compared to wild-type MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates. The striatal levels of MeSHD005680 were not affected by L1 overexpressing MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates. Furthermore, L1 overexpressing, but not wild-type MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates, enhanced MeSHD013534 of endogenous host MeSHD059290 after MeSHQ000637 adjacent to the MeSHD065842. Thus, L1 overexpressing MeSHD013234-derived neural aggregates enhance MeSHD013534 and migration of transplanted MeSHD002477, differentiation into MeSHD059290, MeSHD013534 of endogenous MeSHD059290, and functional recovery after MeSHD014185 in the MeSHD015632 MeSHD051379 model of MeSHD010300.
27499081	Loss and Gain of MeCP2 Cause Similar Hippocampal Circuit MeSHQ000503 that Is Rescued by MeSHD046690 in a MeSHD015518 MeSHD051379 Model.	Loss- and MeSHD000073659 in MeSHD051783 (MECP2) underlie two distinct neurological MeSHD013577 with strikingly similar features, but the synaptic and circuit-level changes MeSHD017008 these shared features are undefined. Here we MeSHD058028 three novel MeSHQ000175 of neural circuit MeSHQ000503 in three MeSHD051379 models of MECP2 disorders (constitutive Mecp2 null, mosaic Mecp2(+/-), and MECP2 duplication): abnormally elevated synchrony in the firing activity of hippocampal CA1 MeSHD017966, an impaired homeostatic response to perturbations of excitatory-inhibitory balance, and decreased excitatory synaptic response in inhibitory MeSHD009474. Conditional MeSHD016296 studies revealed that MeCP2 MeSHQ000503 in excitatory MeSHD009474 mediated elevated synchrony at baseline, while MeCP2 MeSHQ000503 in inhibitory MeSHD009474 increased susceptibility to hypersynchronization in response to perturbations. Chronic forniceal MeSHD046690 (DBS), recently shown to rescue MeSHD006624-dependent MeSHD007858 and MeSHD008568 in Mecp2(+/-) (Rett) MeSHD051379, also rescued all three features of hippocampal circuit MeSHQ000503 in these MeSHD051379.
26317507	PhosphoPath: Visualization of Phosphosite-centric Dynamics in Temporal Molecular Networks.	MeSHD011506 MeSHD010766 is an essential MeSHD011499 (PTM) regulating many MeSHD001686 at the cellular and multicellular level. Continuous improvements in phosphoproteomics MeSHD013672 allow the MeSHQ000032 of this PTM in an expanding MeSHD001688 content, yet up until now MeSHD020543 MeSHD000078326 tools are still very MeSHD005796 centric, hampering the MeSHD001076 to comprehensively MeSHD019532 and study PTM dynamics. Here we present PhosphoPath, a Cytoscape app designed for the visualization and MeSHQ000032 of quantitative MeSHD020543 and phosphoproteome MeSHD064886. PhosphoPath brings MeSHD019359 into the MeSHD001688 network by importing publically available data and enables PTM site-specific visualization of information from quantitative MeSHD013997. To showcase PhosphoPath performance we MeSHQ000706 a quantitative MeSHD040901 MeSHD064886 comparing MeSHD010361-derived MeSHD008545 MeSHD002460 grown in either conventional MeSHD018929 or MeSHD064593.
29225778	MeSHD000071244 reservoirs: Implications for MeSHQ000635, MeSHD005544 MeSHD004196, MeSHD004364 and MeSHD000087506.	MeSHD000071244 (ZIKV) was recently declared as a 'MeSHD014943 MeSHD004630' by the MeSHD014944. Various MeSHD014024 reservoirs of ZIKV in infected MeSHD006801 and MeSHD023421 have been observed, the implications of which are not known. Compared to other MeSHD005416, sexual MeSHQ000635 and persistence in the genitourinary tract seem to be unique to ZIKV. ZIKV persistence and shedding in MeSHD012634 (e.g. MeSHD012463, MeSHD012661) is a concern for potential MeSHD004194 spread and could pose challenges in MeSHD003933, regulatory MeSHQ000592 and MeSHD004364/MeSHD000087506. MeSHD051189 and non-MeSHD006801 MeSHD011323 models could be useful to study the MeSHD012380 of MeSHD014024 reservoirs in the MeSHQ000254 of prophylactic or MeSHD013812 strategies. There is a need for MeSHD017418 of the ZIKV MeSHD007239 and MeSHD017201 data from infected MeSHD010361 and ZIKV MeSHD023421, and additional MeSHD012106 is needed to fully comprehend the long term implications of MeSHD014024 reservoirs on ZIKV MeSHD004194 MeSHQ000209 and MeSHD001695.
