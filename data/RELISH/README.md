# Data examples RELISH

The examples shown in this folder are a reduced dataset from RELISH and **are not a good representation of the dataset**. Most the the results (specially the models and the relevance matrix) **are not** properly generated, and they are here as a result of the tutorials.

**Do not use for any other purposes other than being an example.**

To properly obtain the dataset, please refer to the corresponding [documentation](https://github.com/zbmed-semtec/medline-preprocessing/tree/main/docs/Retrieve_Data)
